2026-10-07 21:39:48 - `tools/cine/run_cine.ps1 build e2m1_ysolde` - hash `c31b872ffcf1ba2b` (2 runs identical)

## Result: **WARN** - quality **96 / 100** (previous run 96, +0)

0 FAIL, 1 WARN, 13 PASS, 12 info, 0 skipped, 0 s

## Improve next
1. **Look at the pictures** (IDEA): run `stills` (windowed) and open stills.png: framing numbers do not judge beauty _(from cine)_
2. **Timing sheet** (IDEA): run `sheet` and read timing.png: line bars show CPS colour _(from cine)_
3. **Two-run hash** (IDEA): the hash in the history must stay the same while the .cine is unchanged _(from cine)_

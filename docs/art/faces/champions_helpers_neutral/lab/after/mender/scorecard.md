## Improve next
1. **Unique materials** (FAIL): B8 9 -> 9 materials: use one material for look-alike pairs (albedo dE <= 15): (no look-alike pair of the same shader) Snap to the closed palette (art-units 2.2); no per-part materials; 4 more to cut: no other pair is a look-alike (the rest differ by dE > 15), so fold per-part copies into the palette materials instead of merging different colours [fixes.json #1] _(from B8 Unique materials)_
2. **Parts above body_height + 0.4** (WARN): R8w Parts above body_height + 0.4: Narrow Merged 0.76 m so the HP bar reads over the head [fixes.json #3] _(from R8w Parts above body_height + 0.4)_
3. **Meshes built per instance** (WARN): B9m Meshes built per instance: Cache the 1 per-instance mesh(es) in a static dictionary [fixes.json #4] _(from B9m Meshes built per instance)_
4. **Vertices** (WARN): B4 8381 -> 4195 (want <= 3000): `Merged` 2993 -> 1497 verts; `Merged` 795 -> 398 verts; `Merged` 707 -> 354 verts; `Face` 656 -> 328 verts; `StaffMesh` 544 -> 272 verts; `Kettle` 510 -> 255 verts; `Core` 432 -> 216 verts; `Jars` 344 -> 172 verts; `Merged` 338 -> 169 verts; `Merged` 338 -> 169 verts; `Variant` 270 -> 135 verts; `Merged` 225 -> 113 verts; `Merged` 225 -> 113 verts (fewer segments: cylinders 6-8, spheres 10 x 5; drop hidden / bottom faces) [fixes.json #2] _(from B4 Vertices)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H0 | Scene instantiates | PASS 100 | root Node3D, 29 nodes | instantiates without errors |  |
| B9 | Materials built per instance | PASS 100 | 0 material(s), 1 mesh(es) not shared by a 2nd instance | 0: materials / meshes are shared per type (art-units 2.2: zero runtime materials); buildings may copy theirs per instance (art-keep 8.6) |  |
| B9m | Meshes built per instance | **WARN** 52 | 1 mesh(es) per instance | meshes shared per type | Build meshes once (static cache or .res) and share them |
| B10 | Allocations after _ready (actions) | PASS 100 | 0 node(s) created, net +0, 2nd action cycle: 0 node(s), 0 new material(s) | 0: pre-built emitters restarted, instance uniforms for flashes (art-units 6.10); materials swapped from a cache are not new |  |
| H1 | Errors from the asset while running | PASS 100 | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) | 0 (its folder + the kit) |  |

## Budgets
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Meshes after the kit merge | PASS 100 | 14 drawn (14 mesh + 0 multimesh); per pivot: Head 3, Censer 2, Chest 2, (root) 1, ArmL 1, ArmR 1 | <= 26 (champions.md 4 / 13, tier3-extras.md 12) |  |

| B8 | Unique materials | **FAIL** 0 | 9 | <= 5 (champions.md 4 / 13, tier3-extras.md 12) | Snap to the closed palette (art-units 2.2); no per-part materials |
| B1a | Authored build parts (before the merge) | INFO | 26 (model says 25) | info only: authoring detail is cheap when the kit merges it (B1 counts the drawn meshes), v1 limit 26 |  |
| B11 | Surfaces per instance | INFO | 17 surfaces over 14 meshes (each surface = 1 draw call) | about 1 surface per mesh after the merge; extra surfaces cost draw calls like extra meshes |  |
| B12 | Downward-facing triangles | INFO | 1671 of 12210 triangles (13%) face steeply down (normal y < -0.7) | hint when > 25 %: the camera looks from above (pitch 55); a sphere has ~15 %, bottom caps add the rest |  |
| B13 | Frame cost | SKIP | headless | needs a windowed run (1600 x 900) |  |

| R8 | Head height vs body_height | PASS 91 | head top 1.95 m / body_height 1.7 (x1.15) | x0.75-1.35 (art-units 1.1: the HP bar hangs at body_height + 0.5; identity crest allowed for champion) |  |
| R8w | Parts above body_height + 0.4 | **WARN** 52 | Merged 0.76 m | narrower than 0.6 m (art-units 1.1: the HP bar stays readable; crest tolerance) | Narrow the hat / horn / staff head above the bar line |
| R10 | Footprint vs selection radius | INFO | x 0.9 / z 0.71 m (radius 0.45, default) | x <= radius x 1.4, z <= x 1.4 (art-units 1.1; parts thinner than 8 cm ignored) |  |

## Craft: shape and detail at the close-up / 25 m (scored, never fails)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Shape richness (secondary shapes) | INFO 100 | 137 shapes over 9 body parts (15.2 per part: LegL 4, LegR 4, Hips 8, Head 36, ArmL 4, Staff 12, Censer 20, ArmR 4, Chest 45); 10% of the surface on plain boxes / prisms (<= 10 face directions); normal variety 0.951 | craft (lab v3.1): >= 7 separate shapes per body part, <= 35% plain boxes / prisms, normal variety >= 0.92 |  |
| C2 | Vertex use vs budget | INFO 100 | 279% of the 3000 verts budget used (8377) | craft (lab v3.1): a finished model uses >= 65% of its tier budget (under-use = detail left on the table; over is B4) |  |

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Chest/Merged 2993 v / 4 s; Root/Chest/Head/Merged 795 v / 1 s; Root/Hips/Merged 707 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/Head/Face 656 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Staff/StaffMesh 544 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Staff/Censer/Kettle 510 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Staff/Censer/Core 432 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/Jars 344 v / 1 s
- 1 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 2 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- Fix recipes: 4 in fixes.json (top: B8 9 -> 9 materials: use one material for look-alike pairs (albedo dE <= 15): (no look-alike pair of the same shader) Snap to the closed palette (art-units 2.2))

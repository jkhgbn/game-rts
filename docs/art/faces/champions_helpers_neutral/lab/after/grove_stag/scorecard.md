## Improve next
1. **Vertices** (WARN): B4 6989 -> 5950 (want <= 6000): `Merged` 2956 -> 1917 verts (fewer segments: cylinders 6-8, spheres 10 x 5; drop hidden / bottom faces) [fixes.json #1] _(from B4 Vertices)_
2. **Meshes built per instance** (WARN): B9m Meshes built per instance: Cache the 1 per-instance mesh(es) in a static dictionary [fixes.json #2] _(from B9m Meshes built per instance)_
3. **Surfaces per instance** (IDEA): Merge surfaces that share a material (37 surfaces for 8 meshes = 37 draw calls) _(from B11)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H0 | Scene instantiates | PASS 100 | root Node3D, 20 nodes | instantiates without errors |  |
| B9 | Materials built per instance | PASS 100 | 0 material(s), 1 mesh(es) not shared by a 2nd instance | 0: materials / meshes are shared per type (art-units 2.2: zero runtime materials); buildings may copy theirs per instance (art-keep 8.6) |  |
| B9m | Meshes built per instance | **WARN** 52 | 1 mesh(es) per instance | meshes shared per type | Build meshes once (static cache or .res) and share them |
| B10 | Allocations after _ready (actions) | PASS 100 | 0 node(s) created, net +0, 2nd action cycle: 0 node(s), 0 new material(s) | 0: pre-built emitters restarted, instance uniforms for flashes (art-units 6.10); materials swapped from a cache are not new |  |
| H1 | Errors from the asset while running | PASS 100 | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) | 0 (its folder + the kit) |  |

## Budgets
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Meshes after the kit merge | PASS 100 | 8 drawn (8 mesh + 0 multimesh); per pivot: (root) 1, Head 1, LegBL 1, LegBR 1, LegFL 1, LegFR 1 | <= 12 (cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount)) |  |
| B2 | Draw instances at rest | PASS 88 | 8 | <= 8 (cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount)) |  |
| B4 | Vertices | **WARN** 43 | 6989 (biggest: Merged 2956, Merged 2521, Merged 343, Merged 343) | <= 6000 soft (cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount)) | Fewer segments (cylinders 6-8, spheres radial 10 / rings 5), no hidden faces |
| B5 | Real lights | PASS 100 | 0 | <= 0 (cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount)) |  |
| B6l | Looping particle systems | PASS 100 | 0 | <= 1 soft (cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount)) |  |
| B7 | Shadow casters | PASS 100 | 1 (Merged) | <= 2 soft (cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount)) |  |
| B8 | Unique materials | INFO | 13 | no budget for mount/mount |  |
| B1a | Authored build parts (before the merge) | INFO | 9 (model says 11) | info only: authoring detail is cheap when the kit merges it (B1 counts the drawn meshes), v1 limit 12 |  |
| B11 | Surfaces per instance | INFO | 37 surfaces over 8 meshes (each surface = 1 draw call) | about 1 surface per mesh after the merge; extra surfaces cost draw calls like extra meshes |  |
| B12 | Downward-facing triangles | INFO | 1079 of 8844 triangles (12%) face steeply down (normal y < -0.7) | hint when > 25 %: the camera looks from above (pitch 55); a sphere has ~15 %, bottom caps add the rest |  |
| B13 | Frame cost | SKIP | headless | needs a windowed run (1600 x 900) |  |

## Readability at 40 m
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Silhouette area at 40 m | SKIP | headless | needs a windowed run (1600 x 900) |  |

| R9 | Feet on the ground | PASS 100 | lowest point 0.019 m | -0.08 .. +0.05 m (art-units 1.6) |  |
| R10 | Footprint vs selection radius | INFO | x 1.31 / z 1.52 m (radius 0.7, default) | x <= radius x 1.4, z <= x 2.4 (art-units 1.1; parts thinner than 8 cm ignored) |  |

## Animation
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Standard hooks | PASS 100 | all 8 present | set_team_color, set_moving, play_hit, play_death, signal:death_finished, set_barded, play_charge, seat_transform |  |
| A2 | death_finished | PASS 100 | after 0.99 s | emitted <= 2.0 s after play_death (gameplay fallback 2.0 s, art-units 6.7) |  |

## Craft: shape and detail at the close-up / 25 m (scored, never fails)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Shape richness (secondary shapes) | INFO 100 | 206 shapes over 7 body parts (29.4 per part: Neck 14, Head 96, LegFL 10, LegFR 10, LegBL 11, LegBR 11, Mount 54); 14% of the surface on plain boxes / prisms (<= 10 face directions); normal variety 0.932 | craft (lab v3.1): >= 7 separate shapes per body part, <= 35% plain boxes / prisms, normal variety >= 0.92 |  |
| C2 | Vertex use vs budget | INFO 100 | 116% of the 6000 verts budget used (6985) | craft (lab v3.1): a finished model uses >= 65% of its tier budget (under-use = detail left on the table; over is B4) |  |

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount))

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Mount/Head/Merged 2956 v / 9 s; Root/Mount/Merged 2521 v / 8 s; Root/Mount/LegBL/Merged 343 v / 4 s; Root/Mount/LegBR/Merged 343 v / 4 s; Root/Mount/LegFL/Merged 289 v / 4 s; Root/Mount/LegFR/Merged 289 v / 4 s; Root/Mount/Neck/Merged 244 v / 3 s; Shadow 4 v / 1 s
- 1 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- Fix recipes: 2 in fixes.json (top: B4 6989 -> 5950 (want <= 6000): `Merged` 2956 -> 1917 verts (fewer segments: cylinders 6-8, spheres 10 x 5; drop hidden / bottom faces))

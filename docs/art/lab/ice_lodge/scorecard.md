## Before / after (vs the run of 2026-10-15 19:18:43 in `docs/art/lab/ice_lodge`: quality 90 -> 90, +0)
### What got worse (0)
Nothing got worse.

Changed pixels per shot: z40 0.3 %, z55 0.2 %, z25 0.4 %, close 0.1 %, turns 0.2 %, anim 0.6 %, silhouette 0.0 %, lineup 0.3 % · [diff sheet](diff_sheet.png) (before / after / changed mask)

## Improve next
1. **Shape richness (secondary shapes)** (INFO): Plain / blocky shapes: few surface directions (normal variety 0.52): tilt, curve and rotate parts so the light breaks on them _(from C1 Shape richness (secondary shapes), shot close)_
2. **Vertex use vs budget** (INFO): Only 24% of the vertex budget is used: spend it on the close / 25 m read (bevels, tapers, more sides on the big curved masses, secondary shapes) _(from C2 Vertex use vs budget, shot close)_
3. **Dominant vertical + asymmetric secondary** (IDEA): Push the one dominant vertical 10-15 % taller and make the secondary element clearly one-sided _(from silhouette)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H0 | Scene instantiates | PASS 100 | root Node3D, 26 nodes | instantiates without errors |  |
| B9 | Materials built per instance | INFO 100 | 11 material(s), 1 mesh(es) not shared by a 2nd instance (per-building copies, accepted by art-keep 8.6) | 0: materials / meshes are shared per type (art-units 2.2: zero runtime materials); buildings may copy theirs per instance (art-keep 8.6) |  |
| B10 | Allocations after _ready (actions) | PASS 100 | 0 node(s) created, net +0, 2nd action cycle: 0 node(s), 0 new material(s) | 0: pre-built emitters restarted, instance uniforms for flashes (art-units 6.10); materials swapped from a cache are not new |  |
| H1 | Errors from the asset while running | PASS 100 | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) | 0 (its folder + the kit) |  |

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, art-keep.md 9 numbers, step-12/13 rules: 0 lights)
`{"draw":32,"frame_ms":0.05,"lights":0,"materials":8,"n":8,"particles":90,"soft":{"runtime_mats":0},"src":"art-keep.md 9 numbers, step-12/13 rules: 0 lights","verts":12000}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Body/Walls 1069 v / 2 s; Body/Dome 970 v / 1 s; Body/Plinth 697 v / 1 s; Rubble 168 v / 1 s x7; Body/Lantern 69 v / 2 s; Body/ChimneyCrystal 62 v / 1 s; Body/Banner 48 v / 1 s; ContactDecal 4 v / 1 s
- 6 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 6 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist

## Improve next
1. **Glow points at 40 m** (WARN): Glow points 1 -> 2 (want 2-4): watchtower_contact_mat emission x 3.31 on ContactDecal (raise over the bloom level: brightest soft glow 0.39 x the level; no energy / glow-colour parameter found) [fixes.json #1] _(from R5 Glow points at 40 m, shot glow)_
2. **Vertices** (WARN): B4 7006 -> 5949 (want <= 6000): `Structure` 6911 -> 5854 verts (fewer segments: cylinders 6-8, spheres 10 x 5; drop hidden / bottom faces) [fixes.json #2] _(from B4 Vertices)_
3. **Standard hooks** (WARN): A1 Standard hooks: Implement set_construction_progress, set_health_ratio, play_destroyed [fixes.json #3] _(from A1 Standard hooks)_
4. **Shape richness (secondary shapes)** (INFO): Plain / blocky shapes: few surface directions (normal variety 0.76): tilt, curve and rotate parts so the light breaks on them _(from C1 Shape richness (secondary shapes), shot close)_
5. **Palette depth (close-up)** (INFO): Flat palette (10 colour / 7 value steps): add a darker and a lighter step of the main colours (trim, recesses, highlights on the top masses) _(from C3 Palette depth (close-up), shot close)_
6. **Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3)** (INFO): On the autumn map the body melts into the ochre floor (dE 27.0): push its main mass out of the L* 25-55 / C* <= 35 band _(from S1 Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3), shot z40)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H0 | Scene instantiates | PASS 100 | root Node3D, 8 nodes | instantiates without errors |  |
| B9 | Materials built per instance | PASS 100 | 0 material(s), 0 mesh(es) not shared by a 2nd instance | 0: materials / meshes are shared per type (art-units 2.2: zero runtime materials); buildings may copy theirs per instance (art-keep 8.6) |  |
| B10 | Allocations after _ready (actions) | PASS 100 | 0 node(s) created, net +0, 2nd action cycle: 0 node(s), 0 new material(s) | 0: pre-built emitters restarted, instance uniforms for flashes (art-units 6.10); materials swapped from a cache are not new |  |
| H1 | Errors from the asset while running | PASS 100 | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) | 0 (its folder + the kit) |  |

## Budgets
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Meshes after the kit merge | INFO | 3 | no budget for building/small |  |
| B2 | Draw instances at rest | PASS 100 | 3 | <= 16 soft (lab default (towers, walls, posts): half a keep) |  |
| B4 | Vertices | **WARN** 43 | 7006 (biggest: Structure 6911, Banner 91, ContactDecal 4) | <= 6000 soft (lab default (towers, walls, posts): half a keep) | Fewer segments (cylinders 6-8, spheres radial 10 / rings 5), no hidden faces |
| B5 | Real lights | PASS 100 | 0 | <= 0 (lab default (towers, walls, posts): half a keep) |  |

| B8 | Unique materials | PASS 95 | 5 | <= 6 soft (lab default (towers, walls, posts): half a keep) |  |
| B1a | Authored build parts (before the merge) | INFO | 6 | info only: authoring detail is cheap when the kit merges it (B1 counts the drawn meshes) |  |
| B11 | Surfaces per instance | INFO | 3 surfaces over 3 meshes (each surface = 1 draw call) | about 1 surface per mesh after the merge; extra surfaces cost draw calls like extra meshes |  |
| B12 | Downward-facing triangles | INFO | 600 of 4512 triangles (13%) face steeply down (normal y < -0.7) | hint when > 25 %: the camera looks from above (pitch 55); a sphere has ~15 %, bottom caps add the rest |  |
| B13 | Frame cost | PASS 100 | 0.0 ms process per instance (8 animated at 40 m: +-0.13 ms process, render CPU +0.13 ms, GPU +0.57 ms) | <= 0.05 ms per instance (lab default (towers, walls, posts): half a keep) |  |

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, lab default (towers, walls, posts): half a keep)
`{"frame_ms":0.05,"lights":0,"n":8,"soft":{"draw":16,"materials":6,"particles":40,"runtime_mats":0,"verts":6000},"src":"lab default (towers, walls, posts): half a keep"}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Body/Structure 6911 v / 1 s; Body/Banner 91 v / 1 s; Body/ContactDecal 4 v / 1 s
- 3 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- Fix recipes: 3 in fixes.json (top: Glow points 1 -> 2 (want 2-4): watchtower_contact_mat emission x 3.31 on ContactDecal (raise over the bloom level: brightest soft glow 0.39 x the level; no ener)

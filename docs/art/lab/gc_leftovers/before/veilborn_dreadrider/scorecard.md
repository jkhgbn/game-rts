1. **Footprint vs selection radius** (WARN): R10: raise UnitType.radius 0.8 -> 0.99, or pull the widest parts in to x <= 1.4 / z <= 1.4 m [fixes.json #1] _(from R10 Footprint vs selection radius)_
2. **Vertices** (WARN): B4 10022 -> 5798 (want <= 6000): `Merged` 3390 -> 1695 verts; `Merged` 3077 -> 1539 verts; `Merged` 668 -> 334 verts; `Merged` 513 -> 257 verts; `Merged` 429 -> 215 verts; `Merged` 429 -> 242 verts (fewer segments: cylinders 6-8, spheres 10 x 5; drop hidden / bottom faces) [fixes.json #2] _(from B4 Vertices)_
3. **Detail density 25 m / 40 m** (INFO): Busy at 25 m (16.0): merge small value changes into bigger blocks so the 40 m read stays clean _(from P4 Detail density 25 m / 40 m, shot z25)_
4. **Distinct from references (black masks)** (PASS): Make it read apart from barrow_knight (IoU 0.66): change one big shape of the silhouette _(from R2 Distinct from references (black masks), shot silhouette)_

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Steed/Root/Mount/Merged 3390 v / 7 s; Steed/Root/Mount/Head/Merged 3077 v / 11 s; Rider/Root/Chest/Merged 668 v / 5 s; Rider/Root/Chest/Head/Merged 513 v / 5 s; Steed/Root/Mount/LegBL/Merged 429 v / 5 s; Steed/Root/Mount/LegBR/Merged 429 v / 5 s; Rider/Root/Chest/Head/Face 428 v / 1 s; Rider/Root/Hips/Merged 418 v / 4 s
- 1 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- Fix recipes: 2 in fixes.json (top: R10: raise UnitType.radius 0.8 -> 0.99, or pull the widest parts in to x <= 1.4 / z <= 1.4 m)

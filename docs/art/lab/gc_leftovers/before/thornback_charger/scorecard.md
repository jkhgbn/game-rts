## Improve next
1. **Team colours for colour-blind players** (WARN): R6cb Team colours for colour-blind players: For red-green colour-blind players fire / nature (deutan) look alike on this model (dE 21.0): add a value step inside the team-colour area [fixes.json #1] _(from R6cb Team colours for colour-blind players, shot teams)_
2. **Contrast on the other grounds** (PASS): On heath the body drops to dE 10.6: add a value accent that separates it there too _(from R4 Contrast on the other grounds, shot z40)_
3. **Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3)** (INFO): On the autumn map the body melts into the ochre floor (dE 9.2): push its main mass out of the L* 25-55 / C* <= 35 band _(from S1 Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3), shot z40)_
4. **Vertex use vs budget** (INFO): Only 57% of the vertex budget is used: spend it on the close / 25 m read (bevels, tapers, more sides on the big curved masses, secondary shapes) _(from C2 Vertex use vs budget, shot close)_
5. **Team-colour visibility at 40 m** (PASS): Give the team colour more top-facing area (now 15% of the 40 m body; aim ~20%): shoulder cloth, a banner, the cape top _(from R6 Team-colour visibility at 40 m, shot teams)_
6. **Distinct from references (black masks)** (PASS): Make it read apart from stagrunner (IoU 0.6): change one big shape of the silhouette _(from R2 Distinct from references (black masks), shot silhouette)_

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Rider/Root/Chest/Merged 1158 v / 9 s; Elk/Root/Mount/Head/Merged 832 v / 7 s; Elk/Root/Mount/Merged 501 v / 7 s; Rider/Root/Hips/Merged 282 v / 5 s; Rider/Root/Chest/ArmL/Merged 187 v / 6 s; Rider/Root/Chest/ArmR/Lance 161 v / 6 s; Elk/Root/Mount/LegFL/Merged 69 v / 3 s; Elk/Root/Mount/LegFR/Merged 69 v / 3 s
- 4 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 1 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- Fix recipes: 1 in fixes.json (top: R6cb Team colours for colour-blind players: For red-green colour-blind players fire / nature (deutan) look alike on this model (dE 21.0): add a value step insid)

1. **Footprint vs selection radius** (WARN): R10: raise UnitType.radius 0.7 -> 1.65, or pull the widest parts in to x <= 1.22 / z <= 1.22 m [fixes.json #1] _(from R10 Footprint vs selection radius)_
2. **Vertices** (WARN): B4 10087 -> 5795 (want <= 6000): `Merged` 3231 -> 1616 verts; `Merged` 1584 -> 792 verts; `Merged` 1443 -> 722 verts; `Merged` 777 -> 389 verts; `Merged` 554 -> 277 verts; `Merged` 498 -> 249 verts; `Lance` 382 -> 191 verts; `Merged` 374 -> 315 verts (fewer segments: cylinders 6-8, spheres 10 x 5; drop hidden / bottom faces) [fixes.json #2] _(from B4 Vertices)_
3. **Detail density 25 m / 40 m** (INFO): Busy at 25 m (12.6): merge small value changes into bigger blocks so the 40 m read stays clean _(from P4 Detail density 25 m / 40 m, shot z25)_
4. **Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3)** (INFO): On the autumn map the body melts into the ochre floor (dE 17.5): push its main mass out of the L* 25-55 / C* <= 35 band _(from S1 Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3), shot z40)_
5. **Distinct from references (black masks)** (PASS): Make it read apart from emberdart_harrier (IoU 0.68): change one big shape of the silhouette _(from R2 Distinct from references (black masks), shot silhouette)_
6. **Team-colour visibility at 40 m** (PASS): Give the team colour more top-facing area (now 14% of the 40 m body; aim ~20%): shoulder cloth, a banner, the cape top _(from R6 Team-colour visibility at 40 m, shot teams)_

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Boar/Root/Mount/Merged 3231 v / 8 s; Boar/Root/Mount/Head/Merged 1584 v / 8 s; Rider/Root/Chest/Merged 1443 v / 6 s; Rider/Root/Hips/Merged 777 v / 5 s; Rider/Root/Chest/Head/Face 612 v / 1 s; Rider/Root/Chest/ArmL/Merged 554 v / 6 s; Rider/Root/Chest/Head/Merged 498 v / 5 s; Rider/Root/Chest/ArmR/Lance 382 v / 6 s
- 3 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 1 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- Fix recipes: 2 in fixes.json (top: R10: raise UnitType.radius 0.7 -> 1.65, or pull the widest parts in to x <= 1.22 / z <= 1.22 m)

## Improve next
1. **Detail density 25 m / 40 m** (INFO): Busy at 25 m (14.2): merge small value changes into bigger blocks so the 40 m read stays clean _(from P4 Detail density 25 m / 40 m, shot z25)_
2. **Contrast on the other grounds** (PASS): On old_wood the body drops to dE 11.5: add a value accent that separates it there too _(from R4 Contrast on the other grounds, shot z40)_
3. **Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3)** (INFO): On the autumn map the body melts into the ochre floor (dE 27.1): push its main mass out of the L* 25-55 / C* <= 35 band _(from S1 Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3), shot z40)_
4. **Tops light, bottoms dark** (INFO): Lighten the top masses / darken the legs and base (top - bottom now +8 L*, aim >= +10) _(from P3 Tops light, bottoms dark, shot z40)_
5. **Contrast under every light preset (meadow)** (PASS): Under the night light the body drops to dE 19.0: add a value step (light top / pale crest) that survives a dim light _(from R12 Contrast under every light preset (meadow), shot z40)_
6. **Contrast vs ground (meadow)** (PASS): Raise the contrast of the key read on meadow (dE 35.5): the body sits in the ground's hue (gap 11 deg): push the main mass away from the grass hue (bronze, brown, blue-grey) or desaturate it _(from R3 Contrast vs ground (meadow), shot z40)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H0 | Scene instantiates | PASS 100 | root Node3D, 18 nodes | instantiates without errors |  |
| B9 | Materials built per instance | PASS 100 | 0 material(s), 0 mesh(es) not shared by a 2nd instance | 0: materials / meshes are shared per type (art-units 2.2: zero runtime materials); buildings may copy theirs per instance (art-keep 8.6) |  |
| B10 | Allocations after _ready (actions) | PASS 100 | 0 node(s) created, net +0, 2nd action cycle: 0 node(s), 0 new material(s) | 0: pre-built emitters restarted, instance uniforms for flashes (art-units 6.10); materials swapped from a cache are not new |  |
| H1 | Errors from the asset while running | PASS 100 | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) | 0 (its folder + the kit) |  |

## Budgets

| B8 | Unique materials | INFO | 6 | no budget for unit/creature |  |
| B1a | Authored build parts (before the merge) | INFO | 4 (model says 10) | info only: authoring detail is cheap when the kit merges it (B1 counts the drawn meshes), v1 limit 18 |  |
| B11 | Surfaces per instance | INFO | 26 surfaces over 10 meshes (each surface = 1 draw call) | about 1 surface per mesh after the merge; extra surfaces cost draw calls like extra meshes |  |
| B12 | Downward-facing triangles | INFO | 422 of 2534 triangles (16%) face steeply down (normal y < -0.7) | hint when > 25 %: the camera looks from above (pitch 55); a sphere has ~15 %, bottom caps add the rest |  |

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, map-fill.md 10 (camp creature = soldier: 18 / 10))
`{"draw":10,"frame_ms":0.005,"lights":0,"meshes":18,"n":100,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":4,"looping":1,"separate":6,"verts":2500},"src":"map-fill.md 10 (camp creature = soldier: 18 / 10)"}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Mount/Head/Merged 650 v / 5 s; Root/Mount/Merged 389 v / 3 s; Root/Mount/Tail 250 v / 4 s; Root/Mount/Head/Frill 226 v / 2 s; Root/Mount/LegFL/Merged 187 v / 2 s; Root/Mount/LegFR/Merged 187 v / 2 s; Root/Mount/LegBL/Merged 187 v / 2 s; Root/Mount/LegBR/Merged 187 v / 2 s
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist

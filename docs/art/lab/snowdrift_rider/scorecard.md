## Improve next
1. **Vertex use vs budget** (INFO): Only 39% of the vertex budget is used: spend it on the close / 25 m read (bevels, tapers, more sides on the big curved masses, secondary shapes) _(from C2 Vertex use vs budget, shot close)_
2. **Tops light, bottoms dark** (INFO): Lighten the top masses / darken the legs and base (top - bottom now +1 L*, aim >= +10) _(from P3 Tops light, bottoms dark, shot z40)_
3. **Distinct from references (black masks)** (PASS): Make it read apart from rime_harrier (IoU 0.65): change one big shape of the silhouette _(from R2 Distinct from references (black masks), shot silhouette)_
4. **Team-colour visibility at 40 m** (PASS): Give the team colour more top-facing area (now 18% of the 40 m body; aim ~20%): shoulder cloth, a banner, the cape top _(from R6 Team-colour visibility at 40 m, shot teams)_

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, cavalry-mounts.md 10 (cavalry rider 12 + mount 8 draws, one scene))
`{"draw":20,"face_verts":1200,"frame_ms":0.01,"lights":0,"meshes":32,"n":100,"particles":10,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":6,"separate":12,"verts":8500},"src":"cavalry-mounts.md 10 (cavalry rider 12 + mount 8 draws, one scene)","systems":1}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Rider/Root/Chest/Merged 1191 v / 9 s; Cat/Root/Mount/Head/Merged 672 v / 4 s; Cat/Root/Mount/Merged 511 v / 6 s; Rider/Root/Hips/Merged 404 v / 5 s; Rider/Root/Chest/ArmR/Merged 212 v / 5 s; Cat/Root/Mount/Tail/Merged 113 v / 2 s; Rider/Root/Chest/ArmL/Merged 71 v / 3 s; Cat/Root/Mount/LegBL/Merged 52 v / 2 s
- 4 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 1 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist

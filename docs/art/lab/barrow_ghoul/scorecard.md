### Score delta per check (4 changed, 48 unchanged)
| # | Check | Before | After | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C4 | Inner detail (close-up / 25 m) | INFO 71 | INFO 85 | +14.1 |
| R5c | Glow points stand out (1 m surround) | PASS 87 | PASS 86 | -1.2 (noisy) |

Changed pixels per shot: z40 0.2 %, z55 0.1 %, z25 0.1 %, close 11.9 %, strike_side 61.6 %, turns 1.1 %, cast 2.7 %, anim 2.7 %, silhouette 6.3 %, lineup 12.5 % · [diff sheet](diff_sheet.png) (before / after / changed mask)

## Improve next
1. **Detail density 25 m / 40 m** (INFO): Busy at 25 m (17.1): merge small value changes into bigger blocks so the 40 m read stays clean _(from P4 Detail density 25 m / 40 m, shot z25)_
2. **Shape richness (secondary shapes)** (INFO): Plain / blocky shapes: 65% of the surface is plain boxes / low-sided prisms: taper, bevel or bend the big limbs and the torso (tapered paths, more sides, a lathe profile) _(from C1 Shape richness (secondary shapes), shot close)_
3. **Contrast on the other grounds** (PASS): On heath the body drops to dE 20.1: add a value accent that separates it there too _(from R4 Contrast on the other grounds, shot z40)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)

`{"draw":14,"frame_ms":0.005,"lights":0,"meshes":26,"n":100,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":4,"looping":1,"particles":10,"separate":6},"src":"art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12","verts":2500}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Chest/Merged 820 v / 5 s; Root/Chest/ArmL/Merged 349 v / 4 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Merged 349 v / 4 s; Root/Chest/Head/Merged 348 v / 4 s; Root/Hips/LegL/Merged 177 v / 3 s; Root/Hips/LegR/Merged 177 v / 3 s; Root/Hips/Merged 149 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/Head/Jaw/JawBone 44 v / 1 s
- 1 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 1 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist

1. **Vertices** (WARN): B4 26025 -> 13016 (want <= 3000): `Merged` 9415 -> 4708 verts; `Staff` 8598 -> 4299 verts; `Variant` 4226 -> 2113 verts; `Merged` 1668 -> 834 verts; `Merged` 983 -> 492 verts; `Merged` 287 -> 144 verts; `Merged` 284 -> 142 verts; `Merged` 280 -> 140 verts; `Merged` 280 -> 140 verts (fewer segments: cylinders 6-8, spheres 10 x 5; drop hidden / bottom faces) [fixes.json #1] _(from B4 Vertices)_
2. **Parts above body_height + 0.4** (WARN): R8w Parts above body_height + 0.4: Narrow Staff 0.71 m so the HP bar reads over the head [fixes.json #2] _(from R8w Parts above body_height + 0.4)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H0 | Scene instantiates | PASS 100 | root Node3D, 25 nodes | instantiates without errors |  |
| B9 | Materials built per instance | PASS 100 | 0 material(s), 0 mesh(es) not shared by a 2nd instance | 0: materials / meshes are shared per type (art-units 2.2: zero runtime materials); buildings may copy theirs per instance (art-keep 8.6) |  |
| B10 | Allocations after _ready (actions) | PASS 100 | 0 node(s) created, net +0, 2nd action cycle: 0 node(s), 0 new material(s) | 0: pre-built emitters restarted, instance uniforms for flashes (art-units 6.10); materials swapped from a cache are not new |  |
| H1 | Errors from the asset while running | PASS 100 | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) | 0 (its folder + the kit) |  |

## Budgets
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Meshes after the kit merge | PASS 100 | 11 drawn (11 mesh + 0 multimesh); per pivot: Head 3, ArmR 2, (root) 1, ArmL 1, Chest 1, Hips 1 | <= 26 (champions.md 4 / 13, tier3-extras.md 12) |  |
| B2 | Draw instances at rest | PASS 98 | 12 | <= 16 (champions.md 4 / 13, tier3-extras.md 12) |  |
| B3 | keep_separate parts | PASS 100 | 3 | <= 6 soft (champions.md 4 / 13, tier3-extras.md 12) |  |
| B4 | Vertices | **WARN** 35 | 26025 (body + face above its allowance: face 708 v, allowance 900, total 26733; biggest: Merged 9415, Staff 8598, Variant 4226, Merged 1668) | <= 3000 soft (champions.md 4 / 13, tier3-extras.md 12) | Fewer segments (cylinders 6-8, spheres radial 10 / rings 5), no hidden faces |
| B5 | Real lights | PASS 100 | 0 | <= 0 (champions.md 4 / 13, tier3-extras.md 12) |  |

| B8 | Unique materials | PASS 89 | 5 | <= 5 (champions.md 4 / 13, tier3-extras.md 12) |  |
| B1a | Authored build parts (before the merge) | INFO | 14 (model says 13) | info only: authoring detail is cheap when the kit merges it (B1 counts the drawn meshes), v1 limit 26 |  |
| B11 | Surfaces per instance | INFO | 14 surfaces over 11 meshes (each surface = 1 draw call) | about 1 surface per mesh after the merge; extra surfaces cost draw calls like extra meshes |  |
| B12 | Downward-facing triangles | INFO | 2821 of 36786 triangles (7%) face steeply down (normal y < -0.7) | hint when > 25 %: the camera looks from above (pitch 55); a sphere has ~15 %, bottom caps add the rest |  |
| B13 | Frame cost | SKIP | headless | needs a windowed run (1600 x 900) |  |

| R8w | Parts above body_height + 0.4 | **WARN** 52 | Staff 0.71 m | narrower than 0.6 m (art-units 1.1: the HP bar stays readable; crest tolerance) | Narrow the hat / horn / staff head above the bar line |
| R10 | Footprint vs selection radius | INFO | x 0.92 / z 0.7 m (radius 0.45, default) | x <= radius x 1.4, z <= x 1.4 (art-units 1.1; parts thinner than 8 cm ignored) |  |

## Craft: shape and detail at the close-up / 25 m (scored, never fails)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Shape richness (secondary shapes) | INFO 80 | 766 shapes over 7 body parts (109.4 per part: LegL 7, LegR 7, Hips 39, Head 172, ArmL 15, ArmR 286, Chest 240); 14% of the surface on plain boxes / prisms (<= 10 face directions); normal variety 0.873 | craft (lab v3.1): >= 7 separate shapes per body part, <= 35% plain boxes / prisms, normal variety >= 0.92 |  |
| C2 | Vertex use vs budget | INFO 100 | 890% of the 3000 verts budget used (26729) | craft (lab v3.1): a finished model uses >= 65% of its tier budget (under-use = detail left on the table; over is B4) |  |

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Chest/Merged 9415 v / 2 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Staff 8598 v / 2 s; Root/Chest/Head/Variant 4226 v / 2 s; Root/Hips/Merged 1668 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/ArmL/Merged 983 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/Head/Face 708 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Merged 287 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/Head/Merged 284 v / 1 s
- 2 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- Fix recipes: 2 in fixes.json (top: B4 26025 -> 13016 (want <= 3000): `Merged` 9415 -> 4708 verts; `Staff` 8598 -> 4299 verts; `Variant` 4226 -> 2113 verts; `Merged` 1668 -> 834 verts; `Merged` 98)

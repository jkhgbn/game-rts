0 FAIL · 0 WARN · 21 PASS · 18 info · 0 skipped · 33 s

## Improve next
1. **Shape richness (secondary shapes)** (INFO): Plain / blocky shapes: few surface directions (normal variety 0.58): tilt, curve and rotate parts so the light breaks on them _(from C1 Shape richness (secondary shapes), shot close)_
2. **Palette depth (close-up)** (INFO): Flat palette (9 colour / 7 value steps): add a darker and a lighter step of the main colours (trim, recesses, highlights on the top masses) _(from C3 Palette depth (close-up), shot close)_
3. **Silhouette hook** (INFO): Give the 40 m silhouette a hook (now 1.39): a shape that breaks the outline, e.g. horns, a raised weapon, a crest, a tail flick, a gap between limbs (at 40 m 1 px = ~4 cm: hooks thinner than ~0.25 m barely register) _(from P1 Silhouette hook, shot silhouette)_
4. **Distinct from references (black masks)** (PASS): Make it read apart from market_shadow (IoU 0.68): change one big shape of the silhouette _(from R2 Distinct from references (black masks), shot silhouette)_
5. **Contrast on the other grounds** (PASS): On ash the body drops to dE 14.3: add a value accent that separates it there too _(from R4 Contrast on the other grounds, shot z40)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H0 | Scene instantiates | PASS 100 | root Node3D, 41 nodes | instantiates without errors |  |
| B9 | Materials built per instance | INFO 100 | 7 material(s), 7 mesh(es) not shared by a 2nd instance (per-building copies, accepted by art-keep 8.6) | 0: materials / meshes are shared per type (art-units 2.2: zero runtime materials); buildings may copy theirs per instance (art-keep 8.6) |  |
| B10 | Allocations after _ready (actions) | PASS 100 | 0 node(s) created, net +0, 2nd action cycle: 0 node(s), 0 new material(s) | 0: pre-built emitters restarted, instance uniforms for flashes (art-units 6.10); materials swapped from a cache are not new |  |
| H1 | Errors from the asset while running | PASS 100 | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) | 0 (its folder + the kit) |  |

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Body/Roof 2131 v / 2 s; Body/Walls 886 v / 2 s; Body/PlinthBase 743 v / 1 s; Body/Yard/YardParts 621 v / 2 s; Body/Furnace/FurnaceStack 243 v / 2 s; Body/Furnace/FurnaceCage 153 v / 1 s; Body/Furnace/SoulOrb 104 v / 1 s; Body/Furnace/FurnaceBanner 48 v / 1 s
- 9 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 6 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist

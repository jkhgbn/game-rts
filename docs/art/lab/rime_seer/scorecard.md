1 FAIL · 1 WARN · 25 PASS · 7 info · 0 skipped · 18 s

## Improve next
1. **Authored meshes** (FAIL): Merge static parts per pivot (kit merge), drop hidden / duplicate parts, repeats as one MultiMesh _(from B1 Authored meshes)_
2. **Parts above body_height + 0.4** (WARN): Narrow Merged 0.43 m so the HP bar reads over the head _(from R8w Parts above body_height + 0.4)_
3. **Tops light, bottoms dark** (INFO): Lighten the top masses / darken the legs and base (top - bottom now +8 L*, aim >= +10) _(from P3 Tops light, bottoms dark, shot z40)_

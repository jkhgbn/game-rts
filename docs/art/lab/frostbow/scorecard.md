## Improve next
1. **Shape richness (secondary shapes)** (INFO): Plain / blocky shapes: 64% of the surface is plain boxes / low-sided prisms: taper, bevel or bend the big limbs and the torso (tapered paths, more sides, a lathe profile); few surface directions (normal variety 0.87): tilt, curve and rotate parts so the light breaks on them _(from C1 Shape richness (secondary shapes), shot close)_
2. **Glow placement** (INFO): Move or add one glow point to the upper half (head, weapon tip, crest) so it reads above other units _(from P5 Glow placement, shot glow)_
3. **Contrast in every team colour (meadow)** (PASS): In the nature team colour the body drops to dE 23.4 on meadow: add a value step around the team-colour area _(from R3t Contrast in every team colour (meadow), shot teams)_

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12)
`{"draw":14,"face_verts":600,"frame_ms":0.005,"lights":0,"meshes":26,"n":100,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":4,"looping":1,"particles":10,"separate":6},"src":"art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12","verts":2500}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Chest/Merged 624 v / 5 s; Root/Chest/Head/Face 492 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/ArmL/Bow/BowBody 437 v / 2 s; Root/Chest/Head/Merged 279 v / 4 s; Root/Chest/ArmL/Merged 216 v / 4 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Merged 216 v / 3 s; Root/Hips/LegL/Merged 214 v / 3 s; Root/Hips/LegR/Merged 214 v / 3 s
- 3 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 5 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist

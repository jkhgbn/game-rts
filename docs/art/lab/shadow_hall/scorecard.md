### What got worse (0)
Nothing got worse.

Changed pixels per shot: z40 0.9 %, z55 0.7 %, z25 1.2 %, close 0.3 %, turns 0.3 %, anim 0.8 %, silhouette 0.0 %, lineup 0.5 % · [diff sheet](diff_sheet.png) (before / after / changed mask)

## Improve next
1. **Shape richness (secondary shapes)** (INFO): Plain / blocky shapes: few surface directions (normal variety 0.54): tilt, curve and rotate parts so the light breaks on them _(from C1 Shape richness (secondary shapes), shot close)_
2. **Silhouette hook** (INFO): Give the 40 m silhouette a hook (now 1.39): a shape that breaks the outline, e.g. horns, a raised weapon, a crest, a tail flick, a gap between limbs (at 40 m 1 px = ~4 cm: hooks thinner than ~0.25 m barely register) _(from P1 Silhouette hook, shot silhouette)_
3. **Vertex use vs budget** (INFO): Only 32% of the vertex budget is used: spend it on the close / 25 m read (bevels, tapers, more sides on the big curved masses, secondary shapes) _(from C2 Vertex use vs budget, shot close)_
4. **Distinct from references (black masks)** (PASS): Make it read apart from market_shadow (IoU 0.69): change one big shape of the silhouette _(from R2 Distinct from references (black masks), shot silhouette)_
5. **Detail density 25 m / 40 m** (INFO): Detail density is low at 25 m (2.7): add 1-2 mid-size value blocks (trim band, belt, plate edge) that read at 25 m and merge at 40 m _(from P4 Detail density 25 m / 40 m, shot z25)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H0 | Scene instantiates | PASS 100 | root Node3D, 38 nodes | instantiates without errors |  |
| B9 | Materials built per instance | INFO 100 | 7 material(s), 8 mesh(es) not shared by a 2nd instance (per-building copies, accepted by art-keep 8.6) | 0: materials / meshes are shared per type (art-units 2.2: zero runtime materials); buildings may copy theirs per instance (art-keep 8.6) |  |
| B10 | Allocations after _ready (actions) | PASS 100 | 0 node(s) created, net +0, 2nd action cycle: 0 node(s), 0 new material(s) | 0: pre-built emitters restarted, instance uniforms for flashes (art-units 6.10); materials swapped from a cache are not new |  |
| H1 | Errors from the asset while running | PASS 100 | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) | 0 (its folder + the kit) |  |

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Body/Walls 1315 v / 2 s; Body/PlinthBase 789 v / 1 s; Body/Roof 729 v / 2 s; Body/BellTower/TowerStack 504 v / 2 s; Rubble 216 v / 1 s x9; Body/PikeRack/RackParts 156 v / 1 s; Body/BellTower/TowerTop 150 v / 1 s; Body/SoulOrb 104 v / 1 s
- 7 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 6 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist

0 FAIL · 1 WARN · 17 PASS · 12 info · 0 skipped · 17 s

## Improve next
1. **Contrast on the other grounds** (WARN): R4 Contrast on the other grounds: On snow the body drops to dE 5.8: add a value accent that separates it there too [fixes.json #1] _(from R4 Contrast on the other grounds, shot z40)_
2. **Tops light, bottoms dark** (INFO): Lighten the top masses / darken the legs and base (top - bottom now -12 L*, aim >= +10) _(from P3 Tops light, bottoms dark, shot z40)_
3. **Detail density 25 m / 40 m** (INFO): Detail density is low at 25 m (1.2): add 1-2 mid-size value blocks (trim band, belt, plate edge) that read at 25 m and merge at 40 m _(from P4 Detail density 25 m / 40 m, shot z25)_
4. **Contrast vs ground (meadow)** (PASS): Raise the contrast of the key read on meadow (dE 41.6): raise the value step between the big masses and the ground (dL +18 now) _(from R3 Contrast vs ground (meadow), shot z40)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H0 | Scene instantiates | PASS 100 | root Node3D, 2 nodes | instantiates without errors |  |
| B9 | Materials built per instance | PASS 100 | 0 material(s), 0 mesh(es) not shared by a 2nd instance | 0: materials / meshes are shared per type (art-units 2.2: zero runtime materials); buildings may copy theirs per instance (art-keep 8.6) |  |
| B10 | Allocations after _ready (actions) | PASS 100 | 0 node(s) created, net +0, 2nd action cycle: 0 node(s), 0 new material(s) | 0: pre-built emitters restarted, instance uniforms for flashes (art-units 6.10); materials swapped from a cache are not new |  |
| H1 | Errors from the asset while running | PASS 100 | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) | 0 (its folder + the kit) |  |

## Budgets
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Meshes after the kit merge | INFO | 1 | no budget for critter/deer |  |
| B2 | Draw instances at rest | PASS 100 | 1 | <= 6 soft (map-fill.md 9 (game critter deer)) |  |
| B4 | Vertices | INFO | 673 | no budget for critter/deer |  |
| B4t | Triangles | PASS 88 | 1134 | <= 1200 (map-fill.md 9 (game critter deer)) |  |

| B8 | Unique materials | PASS 94 | 1 | <= 1 (map-fill.md 9 (game critter deer)) |  |
| B1a | Authored build parts (before the merge) | INFO | 1 | info only: authoring detail is cheap when the kit merges it (B1 counts the drawn meshes) |  |
| B11 | Surfaces per instance | INFO | 1 surfaces over 1 meshes (each surface = 1 draw call) | about 1 surface per mesh after the merge; extra surfaces cost draw calls like extra meshes |  |
| B12 | Downward-facing triangles | INFO | 106 of 1134 triangles (9%) face steeply down (normal y < -0.7) | hint when > 25 %: the camera looks from above (pitch 55); a sphere has ~15 %, bottom caps add the rest |  |
| B13 | Frame cost | PASS 100 | 0.0 ms process per instance (30 animated at 40 m: +-0.0 ms process, render CPU +0.05 ms, GPU +-1.1 ms) | <= 0.005 ms per instance soft (map-fill.md 9 (game critter deer)) |  |

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, map-fill.md 9 (game critter deer))
`{"lights":0,"materials":1,"n":30,"soft":{"draw":6,"frame_ms":0.005,"runtime_mats":0},"src":"map-fill.md 9 (game critter deer)","tris":1200}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Mesh 673 v / 1 s
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- Fix recipes: 1 in fixes.json (top: R4 Contrast on the other grounds: On snow the body drops to dE 5.8: add a value accent that separates it there too)

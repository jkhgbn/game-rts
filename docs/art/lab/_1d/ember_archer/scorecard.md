1. **Footprint vs selection radius** (WARN): R10: raise UnitType.radius 0.45 -> 0.51, or pull the widest parts in to x <= 0.79 / z <= 0.79 m [fixes.json #1] _(from R10 Footprint vs selection radius)_
2. **Contrast in every team colour (meadow)** (WARN): R3t Contrast in every team colour (meadow): In the nature team colour the body drops to dE 7.4 on meadow: add a value step around the team-colour area [fixes.json #2] _(from R3t Contrast in every team colour (meadow), shot teams)_
3. **Team colours for colour-blind players** (WARN): R6cb Team colours for colour-blind players: For red-green colour-blind players fire / nature (deutan) look alike on this model (dE 16.2): add a value step inside the team-colour area [fixes.json #3] _(from R6cb Team colours for colour-blind players, shot teams)_
4. **Glow points stand out (1 m surround)** (WARN): R5c Glow points stand out (1 m surround): 1 glow point(s) barely stand out from their 1 m surround (worst dL +17): darken around them or raise the energy [fixes.json #4] _(from R5c Glow points stand out (1 m surround), shot glow)_
5. **Silhouette hook** (INFO): Give the 40 m silhouette a hook (now 1.98): a shape that breaks the outline, e.g. horns, a raised weapon, a crest, a tail flick, a gap between limbs (at 40 m 1 px = ~4 cm: hooks thinner than ~0.25 m barely register) _(from P1 Silhouette hook, shot silhouette)_
6. **Distinct from references (black masks)** (PASS): Make it read apart from cinder_hand (IoU 0.69): change one big shape of the silhouette _(from R2 Distinct from references (black masks), shot silhouette)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)

## Budgets

| B1a | Authored build parts (before the merge) | INFO | 25 | info only: authoring detail is cheap when the kit merges it (B1 counts the drawn meshes), v1 limit 26 |  |
| B11 | Surfaces per instance | INFO | 22 surfaces over 10 meshes (each surface = 1 draw call) | about 1 surface per mesh after the merge; extra surfaces cost draw calls like extra meshes |  |
| B12 | Downward-facing triangles | INFO | 238 of 1730 triangles (13%) face steeply down (normal y < -0.7) | hint when > 25 %: the camera looks from above (pitch 55); a sphere has ~15 %, bottom caps add the rest |  |

| R7 | HP bar over the body at 40 m | PASS 94 | bar hides 5% of the silhouette (gap -7 px) | <= 8% (FAIL > 25%); bar at body_height + 0.5 = 2.1 m, 1.17 m wide |  |

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12)
`{"draw":14,"frame_ms":0.005,"lights":0,"meshes":26,"n":100,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":4,"looping":1,"particles":10,"separate":6},"src":"art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12","verts":2500}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Chest/Merged 445 v / 6 s; Root/Chest/ArmL/Merged 263 v / 4 s; Root/Chest/Head/Merged 218 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Merged 161 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/ArmL/GlowFireGlow 108 v / 1 s; Root/Hips/LegL/Merged 91 v / 1 s; Root/Hips/LegR/Merged 91 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/GlowFireFlame 84 v / 1 s
- 3 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- Fix recipes: 4 in fixes.json (top: R10: raise UnitType.radius 0.45 -> 0.51, or pull the widest parts in to x <= 0.79 / z <= 0.79 m)

## Improve next
1. **Footprint vs selection radius** (WARN): R10: raise UnitType.radius 0.4 -> 0.43, or pull the widest parts in to x <= 0.7 / z <= 0.7 m [fixes.json #1] _(from R10 Footprint vs selection radius)_
2. **Shape richness (secondary shapes)** (INFO): Plain / blocky shapes: only 4.7 shapes per body part (aim >= 7): add secondary / tertiary shapes (straps, plates, bark ridges, cuffs, knuckles, a collar) on LegL, LegR, ArmL, Lantern; few surface directions (normal variety 0.8): tilt, curve and rotate parts so the light breaks on them _(from C1 Shape richness (secondary shapes), shot close)_
3. **Silhouette hook** (INFO): Give the 40 m silhouette a hook (now 1.89): a shape that breaks the outline, e.g. horns, a raised weapon, a crest, a tail flick, a gap between limbs (at 40 m 1 px = ~4 cm: hooks thinner than ~0.25 m barely register) _(from P1 Silhouette hook, shot silhouette)_
4. **Distinct from references (black masks)** (PASS): Make it read apart from hexweaver (IoU 0.64): change one big shape of the silhouette _(from R2 Distinct from references (black masks), shot silhouette)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |

| B9 | Materials built per instance | PASS 100 | 0 material(s), 0 mesh(es) not shared by a 2nd instance | 0: materials / meshes are shared per type (art-units 2.2: zero runtime materials); buildings may copy theirs per instance (art-keep 8.6) |  |
| B10 | Allocations after _ready (actions) | PASS 100 | 0 node(s) created, net +0, 2nd action cycle: 0 node(s), 0 new material(s) | 0: pre-built emitters restarted, instance uniforms for flashes (art-units 6.10); materials swapped from a cache are not new |  |
| H1 | Errors from the asset while running | PASS 100 | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) | 0 (its folder + the kit) |  |

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, art-units.md 8)
`{"draw":14,"face_verts":800,"frame_ms":0.005,"lights":0,"meshes":22,"n":100,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":4,"looping":0,"separate":6},"src":"art-units.md 8","verts":2500}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Chest/Head/Face 431 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Merged 222 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/Head/Merged 210 v / 2 s; Root/Chest/ArmL/Merged 185 v / 2 s; Root/Chest/Merged 156 v / 3 s; Root/Hips/LegL/Merged 132 v / 1 s; Root/Hips/LegR/Merged 132 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Lantern/LanternOrb 77 v / 1 s
- 3 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- B13 over the budget on the first window (0.4219 ms): re-measured 0.0 ms, kept the lower
- Fix recipes: 1 in fixes.json (top: R10: raise UnitType.radius 0.4 -> 0.43, or pull the widest parts in to x <= 0.7 / z <= 0.7 m)

## Improve next
1. **Shape richness (secondary shapes)** (INFO): Plain / blocky shapes: few surface directions (normal variety 0.71): tilt, curve and rotate parts so the light breaks on them _(from C1 Shape richness (secondary shapes), shot close)_
2. **Contrast on the other grounds** (PASS): On heath the body drops to dE 8.3: add a value accent that separates it there too _(from R4 Contrast on the other grounds, shot z40)_
3. **Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3)** (INFO): On the autumn map the body melts into the ochre floor (dE 16.3): push its main mass out of the L* 25-55 / C* <= 35 band _(from S1 Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3), shot z40)_
4. **Team-colour visibility at 40 m** (PASS): Give the team colour more top-facing area (now 14% of the 40 m body; aim ~20%): shoulder cloth, a banner, the cape top _(from R6 Team-colour visibility at 40 m, shot teams)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H0 | Scene instantiates | PASS 100 | root Node3D, 46 nodes | instantiates without errors |  |
| B9 | Materials built per instance | INFO 100 | 15 material(s), 4 mesh(es) not shared by a 2nd instance (per-building copies, accepted by art-keep 8.6) | 0: materials / meshes are shared per type (art-units 2.2: zero runtime materials); buildings may copy theirs per instance (art-keep 8.6) |  |

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, art-keep.md 9 numbers, step-12/13 rules: 0 lights)
`{"draw":32,"frame_ms":0.05,"lights":0,"materials":8,"n":8,"particles":90,"soft":{"runtime_mats":0},"src":"art-keep.md 9 numbers, step-12/13 rules: 0 lights","verts":12000}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Body/Walls 2580 v / 2 s; Body/LoftTower/TowerStack 2114 v / 3 s; Body/Yard 1621 v / 2 s; Body/Roof 1388 v / 2 s; Mount/MountBody 977 v / 1 s; Body/PlinthFence 948 v / 1 s; Body/PlinthBase 798 v / 1 s; Mount/HeadPivot/MountHead 423 v / 1 s
- 8 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 8 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist

## Improve next
1. **Contrast vs ground (meadow)** (PASS): Raise the contrast of the key read on meadow (dE 22.9): value is close to the ground (dL +2): lighten the top / back 15-20 % or add a dark saddle / pale belly band; the body sits in the ground's hue (gap 25 deg): push the main mass away from the grass hue (bronze, brown, blue-grey) or desaturate it _(from R3 Contrast vs ground (meadow), shot z40)_
2. **Inner detail (close-up / 25 m)** (INFO): Big plain panels inside the silhouette (2.86 inner edges per outline px): break the torso / limbs with secondary shapes and value breaks (belt, plates, straps, bark seams) _(from C4 Inner detail (close-up / 25 m), shot close)_
3. **Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3)** (INFO): On the autumn map the body melts into the ochre floor (dE 14.6): push its main mass out of the L* 25-55 / C* <= 35 band _(from S1 Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3), shot z40)_
4. **Contrast on the other grounds** (PASS): On sand the body drops to dE 15.5: add a value accent that separates it there too _(from R4 Contrast on the other grounds, shot z40)_
5. **Contrast under every light preset (meadow)** (PASS): Under the night light the body drops to dE 19.4: add a value step (light top / pale crest) that survives a dim light _(from R12 Contrast under every light preset (meadow), shot z40)_

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12)
`{"draw":14,"face_verts":800,"frame_ms":0.005,"lights":0,"meshes":26,"n":100,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":4,"looping":1,"particles":10,"separate":6},"src":"art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12","verts":2500}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Chest/Merged 602 v / 6 s; Root/Chest/Head/Merged 498 v / 5 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Coil 401 v / 2 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Merged 219 v / 3 s; Root/Hips/LegL/Merged 182 v / 2 s; Root/Hips/LegR/Merged 182 v / 2 s; Root/Hips/Merged 175 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/ArmL/Merged 170 v / 3 s
- 3 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 4 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist

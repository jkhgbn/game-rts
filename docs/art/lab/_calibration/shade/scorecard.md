## Improve next
1. **Glow points at 40 m** (WARN): Glow points 0 -> 1 (want 1-3): add 1 glow point(s) high on the body (eyes / rune / weapon tip): an unshaded kit glow with energy >= 1.7 or emission x colour >= 1.3 x the bloom level 1.2 [fixes.json #1] _(from R5 Glow points at 40 m, shot glow)_
2. **Shape richness (secondary shapes)** (INFO): Plain / blocky shapes: only 6.1 shapes per body part (aim >= 7): add secondary / tertiary shapes (straps, plates, bark ridges, cuffs, knuckles, a collar) on LegL, LegR, Hips; few surface directions (normal variety 0.84): tilt, curve and rotate parts so the light breaks on them _(from C1 Shape richness (secondary shapes), shot close)_
3. **Inner detail (close-up / 25 m)** (INFO): Big plain panels inside the silhouette (1.76 inner edges per outline px): break the torso / limbs with secondary shapes and value breaks (belt, plates, straps, bark seams) _(from C4 Inner detail (close-up / 25 m), shot close)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H0 | Scene instantiates | PASS 100 | root Node3D, 23 nodes | instantiates without errors |  |
| B9 | Materials built per instance | PASS 100 | 0 material(s), 0 mesh(es) not shared by a 2nd instance | 0: materials / meshes are shared per type (art-units 2.2: zero runtime materials); buildings may copy theirs per instance (art-keep 8.6) |  |
| B10 | Allocations after _ready (actions) | PASS 100 | 0 node(s) created, net +0, 2nd action cycle: 0 node(s), 0 new material(s) | 0: pre-built emitters restarted, instance uniforms for flashes (art-units 6.10); materials swapped from a cache are not new |  |
| H1 | Errors from the asset while running | PASS 100 | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) | 0 (its folder + the kit) |  |

## Budgets
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |

| B8 | Unique materials | INFO | 11 | no budget for unit/soldier |  |
| B1a | Authored build parts (before the merge) | INFO | 27 | info only: authoring detail is cheap when the kit merges it (B1 counts the drawn meshes), v1 limit 26 |  |
| B11 | Surfaces per instance | INFO | 17 surfaces over 10 meshes (each surface = 1 draw call) | about 1 surface per mesh after the merge; extra surfaces cost draw calls like extra meshes |  |
| B12 | Downward-facing triangles | INFO | 206 of 2628 triangles (7%) face steeply down (normal y < -0.7) | hint when > 25 %: the camera looks from above (pitch 55); a sphere has ~15 %, bottom caps add the rest |  |

`{"draw":14,"face_verts":800,"frame_ms":0.005,"lights":0,"meshes":26,"n":100,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":4,"looping":1,"particles":10,"separate":6},"src":"art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12","verts":2500}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Chest/Head/Face 497 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/Merged 295 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Merged 253 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/ArmL/Merged 229 v / 2 s; Root/Chest/Head/Merged 191 v / 3 s; Root/Hips/LegL/Merged 132 v / 1 s; Root/Hips/LegR/Merged 132 v / 1 s; Root/Hips/Merged 37 v / 1 s
- 1 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- quick=1: light-preset sweep (R12) and style bible (S1) skipped
- quick=1: references (R2) and frame cost (B13) skipped
- Fix recipes: 1 in fixes.json (top: Glow points 0 -> 1 (want 1-3): add 1 glow point(s) high on the body (eyes / rune / weapon tip): an unshaded kit glow with energy >= 1.7 or emission x colour >= )

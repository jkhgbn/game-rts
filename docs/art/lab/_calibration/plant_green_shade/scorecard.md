1. **Contrast vs ground (meadow)** (WARN): albedo_color of `StandardMaterial3D#-53555` #8cb847 -> #efff6a (99% of the visible body): predicted dE R3 meadow 10.0 -> 29.0, R3t fire 9.3 -> 28.6, R3t shadow 9.3 -> 28.5, R3t ice 9.3 -> 28.5, R3t nature 9.3 -> 28.5, R4k marsh 74.1 -> 88.8 (want >= 29); other grounds heath 60.3, old_wood 71.3, riverbank 66.2, snow 58.8, ash 88.8, sand 32.4; built in code or embedded: change it where the model script creates it [fixes.json #1] _(from R3 Contrast vs ground (meadow), shot z40)_
2. **Team-colour visibility at 40 m** (WARN): R6 Team-colour visibility at 40 m: Give the team colour more top-facing area (now 0% of the 40 m body; aim ~20%): shoulder cloth, a banner, the cape top [fixes.json #2] _(from R6 Team-colour visibility at 40 m, shot teams)_
3. **Contrast in every team colour (meadow)** (WARN): In the ice team colour the body drops to dE 9.3 on meadow: add a value step around the team-colour area _(from R3t Contrast in every team colour (meadow), shot teams)_
4. **Glow points at 40 m** (WARN): Glow points 0 -> 1 (want 1-3): add 1 glow point(s) high on the body (eyes / rune / weapon tip): an unshaded kit glow with energy >= 1.7 or emission x colour >= 1.3 x the bloom level 1.2 [fixes.json #3] _(from R5 Glow points at 40 m, shot glow)_
5. **Palette depth (close-up)** (INFO): Flat palette (7 colour / 7 value steps): add a darker and a lighter step of the main colours (trim, recesses, highlights on the top masses) _(from C3 Palette depth (close-up), shot close)_
6. **Shape richness (secondary shapes)** (INFO): Plain / blocky shapes: only 6.1 shapes per body part (aim >= 7): add secondary / tertiary shapes (straps, plates, bark ridges, cuffs, knuckles, a collar) on LegL, LegR, Hips; few surface directions (normal variety 0.84): tilt, curve and rotate parts so the light breaks on them _(from C1 Shape richness (secondary shapes), shot close)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Chest/Head/Face 497 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/Merged 295 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Merged 253 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/ArmL/Merged 229 v / 2 s; Root/Chest/Head/Merged 191 v / 3 s; Root/Hips/LegL/Merged 132 v / 1 s; Root/Hips/LegR/Merged 132 v / 1 s; Root/Hips/Merged 37 v / 1 s
- 1 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 1 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- quick=1: light-preset sweep (R12) and style bible (S1) skipped
- quick=1: references (R2) and frame cost (B13) skipped
- Fix recipes: 3 in fixes.json (top: albedo_color of `StandardMaterial3D#-53555` #8cb847 -> #efff6a (99% of the visible body): predicted dE R3 meadow 10.0 -> 29.0, R3t fire 9.3 -> 28.6, R3t shadow )

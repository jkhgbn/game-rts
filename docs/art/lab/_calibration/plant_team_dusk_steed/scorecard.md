## Improve next
1. **Team-colour visibility at 40 m** (WARN): R6 Team-colour visibility at 40 m: Give the team colour more top-facing area (now 2% of the 40 m body; aim ~20%): shoulder cloth, a banner, the cape top [fixes.json #1] _(from R6 Team-colour visibility at 40 m, shot teams)_
2. **Team colours for colour-blind players** (WARN): R6cb Team colours for colour-blind players: For red-green colour-blind players shadow / ice (deutan) look alike on this model (dE 1.1): add a value step inside the team-colour area [fixes.json #2] _(from R6cb Team colours for colour-blind players, shot teams)_
3. **Surfaces per instance** (IDEA): Merge surfaces that share a material (34 surfaces for 8 meshes = 34 draw calls) _(from B11)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H0 | Scene instantiates | PASS 100 | root Node3D, 20 nodes | instantiates without errors |  |
| B9 | Materials built per instance | PASS 100 | 0 material(s), 0 mesh(es) not shared by a 2nd instance | 0: materials / meshes are shared per type (art-units 2.2: zero runtime materials); buildings may copy theirs per instance (art-keep 8.6) |  |
| B10 | Allocations after _ready (actions) | PASS 100 | 0 node(s) created, net +0, 2nd action cycle: 0 node(s), 0 new material(s) | 0: pre-built emitters restarted, instance uniforms for flashes (art-units 6.10); materials swapped from a cache are not new |  |
| H1 | Errors from the asset while running | PASS 100 | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) | 0 (its folder + the kit) |  |

## Budgets
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Meshes after the kit merge | PASS 100 | 8 drawn (8 mesh + 0 multimesh); per pivot: (root) 1, Head 1, LegBL 1, LegBR 1, LegFL 1, LegFR 1 | <= 12 (cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount)) |  |
| B2 | Draw instances at rest | PASS 88 | 8 | <= 8 (cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount)) |  |
| B4 | Vertices | PASS 87 | 5769 (biggest: Merged 2229, Merged 1747, Merged 402, Merged 402) | <= 6000 soft (cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount)) |  |
| B5 | Real lights | PASS 100 | 0 | <= 0 (cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount)) |  |
| B6l | Looping particle systems | PASS 100 | 0 | <= 1 soft (cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount)) |  |
| B7 | Shadow casters | PASS 100 | 1 (Merged) | <= 2 soft (cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount)) |  |
| B8 | Unique materials | INFO | 12 | no budget for mount/mount |  |
| B1a | Authored build parts (before the merge) | INFO | 8 (model says 10) | info only: authoring detail is cheap when the kit merges it (B1 counts the drawn meshes), v1 limit 12 |  |
| B11 | Surfaces per instance | INFO | 34 surfaces over 8 meshes (each surface = 1 draw call) | about 1 surface per mesh after the merge; extra surfaces cost draw calls like extra meshes |  |
| B12 | Downward-facing triangles | INFO | 712 of 6724 triangles (10%) face steeply down (normal y < -0.7) | hint when > 25 %: the camera looks from above (pitch 55); a sphere has ~15 %, bottom caps add the rest |  |

## Readability at 40 m
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R9 | Feet on the ground | PASS 100 | lowest point 0.009 m | -0.08 .. +0.05 m (art-units 1.6) |  |

| R3 | Contrast vs ground (meadow) | PASS 100 | mean-colour dE 98.8, 0% of the body melts (within dE 15 of the ground); body L* 20.3 C 41.2 vs ground L* 62.3 C 48.7, hue gap 167 deg; top third (world height) dE 97.2, L* 21.6; per-pixel dE 102.0, outline 73.7 | mean-colour dE >= 20 and <= 35 % melting (FAIL: dE < 10 or > 60 % melting): the body must not melt into the grass |  |
| R4k | Contrast on the home ground (marsh) | PASS 100 | dE 45.4, 0% melts (marsh is where shadow units stand most) | dE >= 20 on the kingdom's own ground (WARN only; stand-in patch for snow / ash / marsh) |  |

| R6 | Team-colour visibility at 40 m | **WARN** 38 | 2% of body pixels change between kingdom colours (min pair 0%) | >= 6% (FAIL = set_team_color changes nothing) | Put the team colour on a big, top-facing mass (cloth, plates, cape, caparison); ~25-45 %% of the surface (art-keep 0.2 / art-units 1.3) |

| R6cb | Team colours for colour-blind players | **WARN** 35 | worst pair shadow / ice (deutan): dE 1.1 on the team-colour area (normal vision 1.4; 39 px); deutan: shadow / ice dE 1.1; protan: shadow / ice dE 1.2; worst vs ground: nature colour (deutan) dE 80.1 | deutan / protan simulation: the worst kingdom pair differs by mean dE >= 6 on the team-colour area and the body stays >= dE 10 from the ground (WARN only) | Red-green colour blindness merges hues, not values: give the team-colour area a value step or a pattern (trim, banner shape) and keep it large; a team-palette change is for the lead (KINGDOM_COLORS) |
| R5c | Glow points stand out (1 m surround) | PASS 78 | worst dL +5 (point 1 dL +5; ring 24 px = 1.0 m at 40 m) | each glow point's core L* >= the median L* of its 1 m surround + 0 in the lit 40 m frame (WARN only) |  |

| R5w | Glow points while walking (flicker) | PASS 92 | points per frame 1/0/1/1/1/1/1/1 (median 1, range 1, 1 frame(s) at 0; at rest 1) | the glow-point count stays within +-2 over the walk cycle and never drops to 0 (WARN only) |  |

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount))
`{"draw":8,"frame_ms":0.005,"lights":0,"meshes":12,"n":50,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":2,"looping":1,"verts":6000},"src":"cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount)"}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Mount/Merged 2229 v / 6 s; Root/Mount/Head/Merged 1747 v / 8 s; Root/Mount/LegBL/Merged 402 v / 4 s; Root/Mount/LegBR/Merged 402 v / 4 s; Root/Mount/LegFL/Merged 339 v / 4 s; Root/Mount/LegFR/Merged 339 v / 4 s; Root/Mount/Tail/Merged 307 v / 3 s; Shadow 4 v / 1 s
- 2 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- quick=1: light-preset sweep (R12) and style bible (S1) skipped
- quick=1: references (R2) and frame cost (B13) skipped
- Fix recipes: 2 in fixes.json (top: R6 Team-colour visibility at 40 m: Give the team colour more top-facing area (now 2% of the 40 m body; aim ~20%): shoulder cloth, a banner, the cape top)

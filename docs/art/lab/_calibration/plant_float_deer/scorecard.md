## Improve next
1. **Feet on the ground** (FAIL): R9: move `Root` 0.4 m down (lowest point 0.4 -> 0.0 m) [fixes.json #1] _(from R9 Feet on the ground)_
2. **Detail density 25 m / 40 m** (INFO): Busy at 25 m (12.0): merge small value changes into bigger blocks so the 40 m read stays clean _(from P4 Detail density 25 m / 40 m, shot z25)_
3. **Idle / attack beats** (IDEA): Give the idle one secondary motion (tail flick, cloth, head turn) and the attack a 0.1 s anticipation pose so it reads at 40 m _(from anim strip)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H0 | Scene instantiates | PASS 100 | root Node3D, 3 nodes | instantiates without errors |  |
| B9 | Materials built per instance | PASS 100 | 0 material(s), 0 mesh(es) not shared by a 2nd instance | 0: materials / meshes are shared per type (art-units 2.2: zero runtime materials); buildings may copy theirs per instance (art-keep 8.6) |  |
| B10 | Allocations after _ready (actions) | PASS 100 | 0 node(s) created, net +0, 2nd action cycle: 0 node(s), 0 new material(s) | 0: pre-built emitters restarted, instance uniforms for flashes (art-units 6.10); materials swapped from a cache are not new |  |
| H1 | Errors from the asset while running | PASS 100 | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) | 0 (its folder + the kit) |  |

## Budgets
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Meshes after the kit merge | INFO | 1 | no budget for critter/deer |  |
| B2 | Draw instances at rest | PASS 100 | 1 | <= 6 soft (map-fill.md 9 (game critter deer)) |  |
| B4 | Vertices | INFO | 673 | no budget for critter/deer |  |
| B4t | Triangles | PASS 88 | 1134 | <= 1200 (map-fill.md 9 (game critter deer)) |  |
| B5 | Real lights | PASS 100 | 0 | <= 0 (map-fill.md 9 (game critter deer)) |  |
| B7 | Shadow casters | INFO | 1 | no budget for critter/deer |  |
| B8 | Unique materials | PASS 94 | 1 | <= 1 (map-fill.md 9 (game critter deer)) |  |
| B1a | Authored build parts (before the merge) | INFO | 1 | info only: authoring detail is cheap when the kit merges it (B1 counts the drawn meshes) |  |
| B11 | Surfaces per instance | INFO | 1 surfaces over 1 meshes (each surface = 1 draw call) | about 1 surface per mesh after the merge; extra surfaces cost draw calls like extra meshes |  |
| B12 | Downward-facing triangles | INFO | 106 of 1134 triangles (9%) face steeply down (normal y < -0.7) | hint when > 25 %: the camera looks from above (pitch 55); a sphere has ~15 %, bottom caps add the rest |  |

## Readability at 40 m
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R9 | Feet on the ground | **FAIL** 0 | lowest point 0.4 m | -0.08 .. +0.05 m (art-units 1.6) | Lower the feet: the model floats 0.4 m above the ground |

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Standard hooks | PASS 100 | all 5 present | play_idle, play_move, play_flee, play_hit, play_death |  |

## Craft: shape and detail at the close-up / 25 m (scored, never fails)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Shape richness (secondary shapes) | INFO 100 | 28 shapes over 1 body parts (28.0 per part: (root) 28); 3% of the surface on plain boxes / prisms (<= 10 face directions); normal variety 0.872 | craft (lab v3.1): >= 7 separate shapes per body part, <= 30% plain boxes / prisms, normal variety >= 0.86 |  |
| C2 | Vertex use vs budget | INFO 100 | 94% of the 1200 tris budget used (1134) | craft (lab v3.1): a finished model uses >= 80% of its tier budget (under-use = detail left on the table; over is B4) |  |
| C3 | Palette depth (close-up) | INFO 100 | 14 colour steps (L*a*b* bins >= 2 % of the body), 10 value steps (L* bins of 8 >= 3 %) | craft (lab v3.1): >= 10 colour steps and >= 8 value steps at the close-up |  |
| C4 | Inner detail (close-up / 25 m) | INFO 100 | inner edges per outline px: 1.08 at the close-up (31711 px), 0.97 at 25 m; close-up outline complexity 17.3 | craft (lab v3.1): >= 0.7 inner edge px per outline px at the close-up, >= 0.7 at 25 m (shape and value breaks inside the silhouette) |  |

## Polish (scored, never fails)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Silhouette hook | INFO 100 | outline complexity 4.56 | a blob is ~1.3-1.8; a strong hook >= 2.2 |  |
| P3 | Tops light, bottoms dark | INFO 100 | top third L* 52.2, bottom third L* 13.2 (+38, world height) | top lighter than bottom (art-keep 0.1: 0.72 x at the ground, 1.08 x at the top) |  |

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, map-fill.md 9 (game critter deer))
`{"lights":0,"materials":1,"n":30,"soft":{"draw":6,"frame_ms":0.005,"runtime_mats":0},"src":"map-fill.md 9 (game critter deer)","tris":1200}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Mesh 673 v / 1 s
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- quick=1: light-preset sweep (R12) and style bible (S1) skipped
- quick=1: references (R2) and frame cost (B13) skipped
- Fix recipes: 1 in fixes.json (top: R9: move `Root` 0.4 m down (lowest point 0.4 -> 0.0 m))

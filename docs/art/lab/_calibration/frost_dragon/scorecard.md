0 FAIL · 0 WARN · 24 PASS · 18 info · 0 skipped · 35 s

## Improve next
1. **Tops light, bottoms dark** (INFO): Lighten the top masses / darken the legs and base (top - bottom now +9 L*, aim >= +10) _(from P3 Tops light, bottoms dark, shot z40)_
2. **Surfaces per instance** (IDEA): Merge surfaces that share a material (43 surfaces for 17 meshes = 43 draw calls) _(from B11)_
3. **Idle / attack beats** (IDEA): Give the idle one secondary motion (tail flick, cloth, head turn) and the attack a 0.1 s anticipation pose so it reads at 40 m _(from anim strip)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H0 | Scene instantiates | PASS 100 | root Node3D, 39 nodes | instantiates without errors |  |
| B9 | Materials built per instance | PASS 100 | 0 material(s), 0 mesh(es) not shared by a 2nd instance | 0: materials / meshes are shared per type (art-units 2.2: zero runtime materials); buildings may copy theirs per instance (art-keep 8.6) |  |
| B10 | Allocations after _ready (actions) | PASS 100 | 0 node(s) created, net +0, 2nd action cycle: 0 node(s), 0 new material(s) | 0: pre-built emitters restarted, instance uniforms for flashes (art-units 6.10); materials swapped from a cache are not new |  |
| H1 | Errors from the asset while running | PASS 100 | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) | 0 (its folder + the kit) |  |

## Budgets
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Meshes after the kit merge | PASS 100 | 17 drawn (17 mesh + 0 multimesh); per pivot: (root) 1, Body 1, Head 1, Jaw 1, LegBL 1, LegBR 1 | <= 36 (cavalry-mounts.md 10, titans-2.md 11) |  |

| B8 | Unique materials | INFO | 8 | no budget for titan/titan |  |
| B1a | Authored build parts (before the merge) | INFO | 17 | info only: authoring detail is cheap when the kit merges it (B1 counts the drawn meshes), v1 limit 36 |  |
| B11 | Surfaces per instance | INFO | 43 surfaces over 17 meshes (each surface = 1 draw call) | about 1 surface per mesh after the merge; extra surfaces cost draw calls like extra meshes |  |

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, cavalry-mounts.md 10, titans-2.md 11)
`{"draw":20,"lights":0,"looping":2,"meshes":36,"n":12,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":12,"frame_ms":0.02,"verts":12000},"src":"cavalry-mounts.md 10, titans-2.md 11"}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Body/Neck1/Neck2/Head/HeadMesh 1418 v / 4 s; Root/Body/BodyMesh 1263 v / 2 s; Root/Body/WingL/WingL2/WingL2Mesh 771 v / 3 s; Root/Body/WingR/WingR2/WingR2Mesh 771 v / 3 s; Root/Body/WingL/WingLMesh 532 v / 4 s; Root/Body/WingR/WingRMesh 532 v / 4 s; Root/Body/Neck1/Neck2/Head/Jaw/JawMesh 466 v / 4 s; Root/Body/Tail1/Tail2/Tail3/Tail3Mesh 367 v / 2 s
- 2 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- quick=1: light-preset sweep (R12) and style bible (S1) skipped
- quick=1: references (R2) and frame cost (B13) skipped

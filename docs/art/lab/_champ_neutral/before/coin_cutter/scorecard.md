## Improve next
1. **Unique materials** (FAIL): B8 8 -> 8 materials: use one material for look-alike pairs (albedo dE <= 15): (no look-alike pair of the same shader) Snap to the closed palette (art-units 2.2); no per-part materials; 3 more to cut: no other pair is a look-alike (the rest differ by dE > 15), so fold per-part copies into the palette materials instead of merging different colours [fixes.json #1] _(from B8 Unique materials)_
2. **Glow points at 40 m** (WARN): Glow points 0 -> 1 (want 1-4): add 1 glow point(s) high on the body (eyes / rune / weapon tip): an unshaded kit glow with energy >= 1.7 or emission x colour >= 1.3 x the bloom level 1.2 [fixes.json #2] _(from R5 Glow points at 40 m, shot glow)_
3. **Vertices** (WARN): B4 3157 -> 2992 (want <= 3000): `Merged` 682 -> 517 verts (fewer segments: cylinders 6-8, spheres 10 x 5; drop hidden / bottom faces) [fixes.json #3] _(from B4 Vertices)_
4. **Palette depth (close-up)** (INFO): Flat palette (10 colour / 8 value steps): add a darker and a lighter step of the main colours (trim, recesses, highlights on the top masses) _(from C3 Palette depth (close-up), shot close)_
5. **Tops light, bottoms dark** (INFO): Lighten the top masses / darken the legs and base (top - bottom now -1 L*, aim >= +10) _(from P3 Tops light, bottoms dark, shot z40)_
6. **Distinct from references (black masks)** (PASS): Make it read apart from tracker (IoU 0.69): change one big shape of the silhouette _(from R2 Distinct from references (black masks), shot silhouette)_

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, champions.md 4 / 13, tier3-extras.md 12)
`{"draw":16,"face_verts":900,"frame_ms":0.005,"lights":0,"materials":5,"meshes":26,"n":100,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":4,"looping":1,"particles":8,"separate":6,"verts":3000},"src":"champions.md 4 / 13, tier3-extras.md 12"}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Chest/Merged 682 v / 4 s; Root/Chest/Head/Face 672 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/Head/Merged 456 v / 3 s; Root/Hips/Merged 447 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/ArmL/Merged 381 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Merged 381 v / 3 s; Root/Hips/LootSack 267 v / 4 s; Root/Hips/LegL/Merged 189 v / 3 s
- 3 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 1 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- Fix recipes: 3 in fixes.json (top: B8 8 -> 8 materials: use one material for look-alike pairs (albedo dE <= 15): (no look-alike pair of the same shader) Snap to the closed palette (art-units 2.2))

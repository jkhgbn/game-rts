# Art Lab scorecard: bloomtender

Scene `res://art/units/nature/bloomtender.tscn` · kind **unit** / tier **soldier** · kingdom nature · ground meadow · 2026-09-26 22:56:44 · lab v1.0

## Result: **WARN** · quality **92 / 100**

0 FAIL · 2 WARN · 25 PASS · 7 info · 0 skipped · 19 s

## Improve next
1. **Parts above body_height + 0.4** (WARN): Narrow Merged 0.43 m so the HP bar reads over the head _(from R8w Parts above body_height + 0.4)_
2. **Contrast vs ground (meadow)** (PASS): Raise the contrast of the key read on meadow (dE 20.8): value is close to the ground (dL -4): lighten the top / back 15-20 % or add a dark saddle / pale belly band; the body sits in the ground's hue (gap 11 deg): push the main mass away from the grass hue (bronze, brown, blue-grey) or desaturate it _(from R3 Contrast vs ground (meadow), shot z40)_
3. **Contrast on the other grounds** (PASS): On heath the body drops to dE 12.0: add a value accent that separates it there too _(from R4 Contrast on the other grounds, shot z40)_

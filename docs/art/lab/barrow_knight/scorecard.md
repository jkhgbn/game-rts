## Improve next
1. **Footprint vs selection radius** (WARN): R10: raise UnitType.radius 0.7 -> 0.83, or pull the widest parts in to x <= 1.22 / z <= 1.22 m [fixes.json #1] _(from R10 Footprint vs selection radius)_
2. **Vertices** (WARN): B4 12487 -> 8300 (want <= 8500): `Merged` 3615 -> 1808 verts; `Merged` 3246 -> 1623 verts; `Merged` 1524 -> 767 verts (fewer segments: cylinders 6-8, spheres 10 x 5; drop hidden / bottom faces) [fixes.json #2] _(from B4 Vertices)_
3. **Detail density 25 m / 40 m** (INFO): Busy at 25 m (19.4): merge small value changes into bigger blocks so the 40 m read stays clean _(from P4 Detail density 25 m / 40 m, shot z25)_
4. **Distinct from references (black masks)** (PASS): Make it read apart from veilborn_dreadrider (IoU 0.66): change one big shape of the silhouette _(from R2 Distinct from references (black masks), shot silhouette)_
5. **Contrast on the other grounds** (PASS): On ash the body drops to dE 23.5: add a value accent that separates it there too _(from R4 Contrast on the other grounds, shot z40)_
6. **Team-colour visibility at 40 m** (PASS): Give the team colour more top-facing area (now 18% of the 40 m body; aim ~20%): shoulder cloth, a banner, the cape top _(from R6 Team-colour visibility at 40 m, shot teams)_

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, cavalry-mounts.md 10 (cavalry rider 12 + mount 8 draws, one scene))
`{"draw":20,"face_verts":1200,"frame_ms":0.01,"lights":0,"meshes":32,"n":100,"particles":10,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":6,"separate":12,"verts":8500},"src":"cavalry-mounts.md 10 (cavalry rider 12 + mount 8 draws, one scene)","systems":1}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Steed/Root/Mount/Merged 3615 v / 7 s; Steed/Root/Mount/Head/Merged 3246 v / 12 s; Rider/Root/Chest/Merged 1524 v / 6 s; Rider/Root/Hips/Merged 1176 v / 6 s; Rider/Root/Chest/ArmL/Merged 588 v / 6 s; Rider/Root/Chest/Head/Merged 550 v / 4 s; Rider/Root/Chest/ArmR/Merged 495 v / 3 s; Rider/Root/Chest/Head/Face 390 v / 1 s
- 2 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- Fix recipes: 2 in fixes.json (top: R10: raise UnitType.radius 0.7 -> 0.83, or pull the widest parts in to x <= 1.22 / z <= 1.22 m)

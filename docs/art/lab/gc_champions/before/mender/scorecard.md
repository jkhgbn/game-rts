3. **Contrast vs ground (meadow)** (PASS): Raise the contrast of the key read on meadow (dE 25.0): raise the value step between the big masses and the ground (dL -14 now) _(from R3 Contrast vs ground (meadow), shot z40)_
4. **Contrast on the other grounds** (PASS): On sand the body drops to dE 15.2: add a value accent that separates it there too _(from R4 Contrast on the other grounds, shot z40)_
5. **Tops light, bottoms dark** (INFO): Lighten the top masses / darken the legs and base (top - bottom now +6 L*, aim >= +10) _(from P3 Tops light, bottoms dark, shot z40)_

`{"draw":16,"face_verts":900,"frame_ms":0.005,"lights":0,"materials":5,"meshes":26,"n":100,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":4,"looping":1,"particles":8,"separate":6,"verts":3000},"src":"champions.md 4 / 13, tier3-extras.md 12"}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Chest/Merged 2949 v / 2 s; Root/Chest/Head/Merged 747 v / 1 s; Root/Hips/Merged 707 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/Head/Face 656 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Staff/StaffMesh 544 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Staff/Censer/Kettle 510 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Staff/Censer/Core 432 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/Jars 344 v / 1 s
- 1 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 1 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- Fix recipes: 2 in fixes.json (top: B4 7633 -> 3821 (want <= 3000): `Merged` 2949 -> 1475 verts; `Merged` 747 -> 374 verts; `Merged` 707 -> 354 verts; `StaffMesh` 544 -> 272 verts; `Kettle` 510 ->)

## Improve next
1. **Footprint vs selection radius** (WARN): R10: raise UnitType.radius 0.4 -> 0.52, or pull the widest parts in to x <= 0.7 / z <= 0.7 m [fixes.json #1] _(from R10 Footprint vs selection radius)_
2. **Inner detail (close-up / 25 m)** (INFO): Big plain panels inside the silhouette (2.82 inner edges per outline px): break the torso / limbs with secondary shapes and value breaks (belt, plates, straps, bark seams) _(from C4 Inner detail (close-up / 25 m), shot close)_
3. **Contrast on the other grounds** (PASS): On sand the body drops to dE 11.2: add a value accent that separates it there too _(from R4 Contrast on the other grounds, shot z40)_
4. **Contrast vs ground (meadow)** (PASS): Raise the contrast of the key read on meadow (dE 22.6): value is close to the ground (dL +7): lighten the top / back 15-20 % or add a dark saddle / pale belly band; the body sits in the ground's hue (gap 16 deg): push the main mass away from the grass hue (bronze, brown, blue-grey) or desaturate it _(from R3 Contrast vs ground (meadow), shot z40)_
5. **Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3)** (INFO): On the autumn map the body melts into the ochre floor (dE 22.6): push its main mass out of the L* 25-55 / C* <= 35 band _(from S1 Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3), shot z40)_
6. **Contrast in every team colour (meadow)** (PASS): In the nature team colour the body drops to dE 22.7 on meadow: add a value step around the team-colour area _(from R3t Contrast in every team colour (meadow), shot teams)_

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12)
`{"draw":14,"face_verts":800,"frame_ms":0.005,"lights":0,"meshes":26,"n":100,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":4,"looping":1,"particles":10,"separate":6},"src":"art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12","verts":2500}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Chest/Head/Merged 542 v / 5 s; Root/Chest/Merged 511 v / 4 s; Root/Chest/Head/Face 456 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Merged 353 v / 4 s; Root/Hips/LegL/Merged 153 v / 2 s; Root/Hips/LegR/Merged 153 v / 2 s; Root/Hips/Merged 150 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/ArmL/Merged 122 v / 1 s
- 1 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 5 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- Fix recipes: 1 in fixes.json (top: R10: raise UnitType.radius 0.4 -> 0.52, or pull the widest parts in to x <= 0.7 / z <= 0.7 m)

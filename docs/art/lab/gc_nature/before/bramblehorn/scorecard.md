## Improve next
1. **Team colours for colour-blind players** (WARN): R6cb Team colours for colour-blind players: For red-green colour-blind players fire / nature (deutan) look alike on this model (dE 11.1): add a value step inside the team-colour area [fixes.json #1] _(from R6cb Team colours for colour-blind players, shot teams)_
2. **Silhouette hook** (INFO): Give the 40 m silhouette a hook (now 1.56): a shape that breaks the outline, e.g. horns, a raised weapon, a crest, a tail flick, a gap between limbs (at 40 m 1 px = ~4 cm: hooks thinner than ~0.25 m barely register) _(from P1 Silhouette hook, shot silhouette)_
3. **Asymmetric secondary shape** (INFO): Add an asymmetric secondary element to the front read (asymmetry 0.06): a shoulder banner, a one-sided weapon / shield, a broken horn (>= ~0.25 m wide, or it does not register at 40 m) _(from P2 Asymmetric secondary shape, shot silhouette)_
4. **Contrast on the other grounds** (PASS): On sand the body drops to dE 10.1: add a value accent that separates it there too _(from R4 Contrast on the other grounds, shot z40)_
5. **Contrast vs ground (meadow)** (PASS): Raise the contrast of the key read on meadow (dE 23.2): value is close to the ground (dL +9): lighten the top / back 15-20 % or add a dark saddle / pale belly band; the body sits in the ground's hue (gap 23 deg): push the main mass away from the grass hue (bronze, brown, blue-grey) or desaturate it _(from R3 Contrast vs ground (meadow), shot z40)_
6. **Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3)** (INFO): On the autumn map the body melts into the ochre floor (dE 21.0): push its main mass out of the L* 25-55 / C* <= 35 band _(from S1 Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3), shot z40)_

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Mount/Merged 1588 v / 8 s; Root/Mount/Head/Merged 1123 v / 6 s; Root/Mount/Head/Face 534 v / 1 s; Root/Mount/LegBL/Merged 243 v / 3 s; Root/Mount/LegBR/Merged 243 v / 3 s; Root/Mount/LegFL/Merged 196 v / 3 s; Root/Mount/LegFR/Merged 196 v / 3 s; Shadow 4 v / 1 s
- 7 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- Fix recipes: 1 in fixes.json (top: R6cb Team colours for colour-blind players: For red-green colour-blind players fire / nature (deutan) look alike on this model (dE 11.1): add a value step insid)

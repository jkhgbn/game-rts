## Improve next
1. **Head height vs body_height** (WARN): R8: body_height 1.6 -> 2.28 in res://art/units/nature/bloomtender.tscn (root) and res://data/units/bloomtender.tres (the head top; x1.42 now), or lower the head / crest 0.28 m [fixes.json #1] _(from R8 Head height vs body_height)_
2. **Parts above body_height + 0.4** (WARN): R8w Parts above body_height + 0.4: Narrow Merged 0.45 m so the HP bar reads over the head [fixes.json #2] _(from R8w Parts above body_height + 0.4)_
3. **Team colours for colour-blind players** (WARN): R6cb Team colours for colour-blind players: For red-green colour-blind players fire / nature (deutan) look alike on this model (dE 18.7): add a value step inside the team-colour area [fixes.json #3] _(from R6cb Team colours for colour-blind players, shot teams)_
4. **Contrast on the other grounds** (PASS): On sand the body drops to dE 14.0: add a value accent that separates it there too _(from R4 Contrast on the other grounds, shot z40)_
5. **Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3)** (INFO): On the autumn map the body melts into the ochre floor (dE 15.8): push its main mass out of the L* 25-55 / C* <= 35 band _(from S1 Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3), shot z40)_
6. **Contrast vs ground (meadow)** (PASS): Raise the contrast of the key read on meadow (dE 27.1): value is close to the ground (dL +3): lighten the top / back 15-20 % or add a dark saddle / pale belly band; the body sits in the ground's hue (gap 30 deg): push the main mass away from the grass hue (bronze, brown, blue-grey) or desaturate it _(from R3 Contrast vs ground (meadow), shot z40)_

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Chest/Head/Hat/HatMesh 584 v / 6 s; Root/Hips/Merged 476 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/Head/Face 408 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Censer/Pod 352 v / 4 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Merged 236 v / 5 s; Root/Chest/Merged 217 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/Head/Merged 131 v / 2 s; Root/Chest/ArmL/Merged 82 v / 2 s
- 1 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 4 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- Fix recipes: 3 in fixes.json (top: R8: body_height 1.6 -> 2.28 in res://art/units/nature/bloomtender.tscn (root) and res://data/units/bloomtender.tres (the head top; x1.42 now), or lower the head)

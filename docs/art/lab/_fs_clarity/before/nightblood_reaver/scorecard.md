## Improve next
1. **Shape richness (secondary shapes)** (INFO): Plain / blocky shapes: 72% of the surface is plain boxes / low-sided prisms: taper, bevel or bend the big limbs and the torso (tapered paths, more sides, a lathe profile); few surface directions (normal variety 0.83): tilt, curve and rotate parts so the light breaks on them _(from C1 Shape richness (secondary shapes), shot close)_
2. **Detail density 25 m / 40 m** (INFO): Busy at 25 m (17.0): merge small value changes into bigger blocks so the 40 m read stays clean _(from P4 Detail density 25 m / 40 m, shot z25)_
3. **Palette depth (close-up)** (INFO): Flat palette (11 colour / 8 value steps): add a darker and a lighter step of the main colours (trim, recesses, highlights on the top masses) _(from C3 Palette depth (close-up), shot close)_
4. **Tops light, bottoms dark** (INFO): Lighten the top masses / darken the legs and base (top - bottom now +4 L*, aim >= +10) _(from P3 Tops light, bottoms dark, shot z40)_
5. **Asymmetric secondary shape** (INFO): Add an asymmetric secondary element to the front read (asymmetry 0.14): a shoulder banner, a one-sided weapon / shield, a broken horn (>= ~0.25 m wide, or it does not register at 40 m) _(from P2 Asymmetric secondary shape, shot silhouette)_
6. **Distinct from references (black masks)** (PASS): Make it read apart from nightbolt (IoU 0.63): change one big shape of the silhouette _(from R2 Distinct from references (black masks), shot silhouette)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| B9 | Materials built per instance | PASS 100 | 0 material(s), 0 mesh(es) not shared by a 2nd instance | 0: materials / meshes are shared per type (art-units 2.2: zero runtime materials); buildings may copy theirs per instance (art-keep 8.6) |  |
| B10 | Allocations after _ready (actions) | PASS 100 | 0 node(s) created, net +0, 2nd action cycle: 0 node(s), 0 new material(s) | 0: pre-built emitters restarted, instance uniforms for flashes (art-units 6.10); materials swapped from a cache are not new |  |
| H1 | Errors from the asset while running | PASS 100 | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) | 0 (its folder + the kit) |  |

## Budgets

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12)
`{"draw":14,"face_verts":800,"frame_ms":0.005,"lights":0,"meshes":26,"n":100,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":4,"looping":1,"particles":10,"separate":6},"src":"art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12","verts":2500}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Chest/ArmR/Merged 540 v / 6 s; Root/Chest/Merged 532 v / 6 s; Root/Chest/Head/Face 398 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/ArmL/Merged 346 v / 4 s; Root/Hips/Merged 273 v / 6 s; Root/Chest/Head/Merged 152 v / 2 s; Root/Hips/LegL/Merged 127 v / 4 s; Root/Hips/LegR/Merged 127 v / 4 s
- 1 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 2 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist

## Improve next
1. **Detail density 25 m / 40 m** (INFO): Busy at 25 m (13.4): merge small value changes into bigger blocks so the 40 m read stays clean _(from P4 Detail density 25 m / 40 m, shot z25)_
2. **Inner detail (close-up / 25 m)** (INFO): Big plain panels inside the silhouette (2.26 inner edges per outline px): break the torso / limbs with secondary shapes and value breaks (belt, plates, straps, bark seams) _(from C4 Inner detail (close-up / 25 m), shot close)_
3. **Team-colour visibility at 40 m** (PASS): Give the team colour more top-facing area (now 14% of the 40 m body; aim ~20%): shoulder cloth, a banner, the cape top _(from R6 Team-colour visibility at 40 m, shot teams)_
4. **Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3)** (INFO): On the autumn map the body melts into the ochre floor (dE 25.5): push its main mass out of the L* 25-55 / C* <= 35 band _(from S1 Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3), shot z40)_
5. **Distinct from references (black masks)** (PASS): Make it read apart from scorchling_placeholder (IoU 0.61): change one big shape of the silhouette _(from R2 Distinct from references (black masks), shot silhouette)_

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12)
`{"draw":14,"face_verts":800,"frame_ms":0.005,"lights":0,"meshes":26,"n":100,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":4,"looping":1,"particles":10,"separate":6},"src":"art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12","verts":2500}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Chest/Head/Face 416 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/Merged 405 v / 4 s; Root/Chest/Head/Merged 304 v / 4 s; Root/Chest/ArmL/Merged 290 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Merged 290 v / 3 s; Root/Hips/Merged 208 v / 4 s; Root/Hips/LegL/Merged 188 v / 2 s; Root/Hips/LegR/Merged 188 v / 2 s
- 1 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 3 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist

## Improve next
1. **Footprint vs selection radius** (WARN): R10: raise UnitType.radius 0.45 -> 0.47, or pull the widest parts in to x <= 0.79 / z <= 0.79 m [fixes.json #1] _(from R10 Footprint vs selection radius)_
2. **Parts above body_height + 0.4** (WARN): R8w Parts above body_height + 0.4: Narrow AshBall 0.43 m, Merged 0.43 m so the HP bar reads over the head [fixes.json #2] _(from R8w Parts above body_height + 0.4)_
3. **Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3)** (INFO): On the autumn map the body melts into the ochre floor (dE 23.2): push its main mass out of the L* 25-55 / C* <= 35 band _(from S1 Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3), shot z40)_
4. **Team-colour visibility at 40 m** (PASS): Give the team colour more top-facing area (now 15% of the 40 m body; aim ~20%): shoulder cloth, a banner, the cape top _(from R6 Team-colour visibility at 40 m, shot teams)_
5. **Tops light, bottoms dark** (INFO): Lighten the top masses / darken the legs and base (top - bottom now +9 L*, aim >= +10) _(from P3 Tops light, bottoms dark, shot z40)_

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12)
`{"draw":14,"face_verts":800,"frame_ms":0.005,"lights":0,"meshes":26,"n":100,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":4,"looping":1,"particles":10,"separate":6},"src":"art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12","verts":2500}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Chest/Merged 852 v / 6 s; Root/Chest/Head/Face 594 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Merged 386 v / 4 s; Root/Chest/Head/Merged 371 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/ArmL/Merged 188 v / 3 s; Root/Hips/LegL/Merged 166 v / 2 s; Root/Hips/LegR/Merged 166 v / 2 s; Root/Chest/Head/GlowFireGlow 114 v / 1 s
- 1 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- B13 over the budget on the first window (0.0149 ms): re-measured 0.0 ms, kept the lower
- Fix recipes: 2 in fixes.json (top: R10: raise UnitType.radius 0.45 -> 0.47, or pull the widest parts in to x <= 0.79 / z <= 0.79 m)

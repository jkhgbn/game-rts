## Improve next
1. **Silhouette hook** (INFO): Give the 40 m silhouette a hook (now 1.96): a shape that breaks the outline, e.g. horns, a raised weapon, a crest, a tail flick, a gap between limbs (at 40 m 1 px = ~4 cm: hooks thinner than ~0.25 m barely register) _(from P1 Silhouette hook, shot silhouette)_
2. **Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3)** (INFO): On the autumn map the body melts into the ochre floor (dE 19.7): push its main mass out of the L* 25-55 / C* <= 35 band _(from S1 Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3), shot z40)_
3. **Distinct from references (black masks)** (PASS): Make it read apart from cinderlock (IoU 0.67): change one big shape of the silhouette _(from R2 Distinct from references (black masks), shot silhouette)_
4. **Team-colour visibility at 40 m** (PASS): Give the team colour more top-facing area (now 18% of the 40 m body; aim ~20%): shoulder cloth, a banner, the cape top _(from R6 Team-colour visibility at 40 m, shot teams)_

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12)
`{"draw":14,"face_verts":800,"frame_ms":0.005,"lights":0,"meshes":26,"n":100,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":4,"looping":1,"particles":10,"separate":6},"src":"art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12","verts":2500}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Chest/Merged 616 v / 5 s; Root/Chest/Head/Face 392 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/Head/Merged 345 v / 4 s; Root/Hips/Merged 342 v / 4 s; Root/Chest/ArmL/Bow/BowBody 213 v / 2 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Merged 144 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/ArmL/Merged 132 v / 2 s; Root/Hips/LegL/Merged 116 v / 3 s
- 4 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 2 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist

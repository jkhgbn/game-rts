## Improve next
1. **Head height vs body_height** (WARN): R8: body_height 1.7 -> 2.18 in res://art/units/fire/cinderlock/cinderlock.tscn (root) (the head top; x1.28 now), or lower the head / crest 0.06 m [fixes.json #1] _(from R8 Head height vs body_height)_
2. **Frame cost** (WARN): B13 Frame cost: Cut the per-frame script cost (0.006 ms per instance): write pivots only when they change, skip work at the far tiers [fixes.json #2] _(from B13 Frame cost)_
3. **Tops light, bottoms dark** (INFO): Lighten the top masses / darken the legs and base (top - bottom now -6 L*, aim >= +10) _(from P3 Tops light, bottoms dark, shot z40)_
4. **Silhouette hook** (INFO): Give the 40 m silhouette a hook (now 1.64): a shape that breaks the outline, e.g. horns, a raised weapon, a crest, a tail flick, a gap between limbs (at 40 m 1 px = ~4 cm: hooks thinner than ~0.25 m barely register) _(from P1 Silhouette hook, shot silhouette)_
5. **Distinct from references (black masks)** (PASS): Make it read apart from cinder_arbalest_placeholder (IoU 0.7): change one big shape of the silhouette _(from R2 Distinct from references (black masks), shot silhouette)_
6. **Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3)** (INFO): On the autumn map the body melts into the ochre floor (dE 25.6): push its main mass out of the L* 25-55 / C* <= 35 band _(from S1 Style bible: golden autumn (style-autumn.md 3), shot z40)_

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12)
`{"draw":14,"face_verts":800,"frame_ms":0.005,"lights":0,"meshes":26,"n":100,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":4,"looping":1,"particles":10,"separate":6},"src":"art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12","verts":2500}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Chest/Head/Merged 705 v / 5 s; Root/Chest/Head/Face 676 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/Merged 546 v / 5 s; Root/Chest/Musket 404 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/GlowFireGlow 150 v / 1 s; Root/Hips/LegL/Merged 148 v / 2 s; Root/Hips/LegR/Merged 148 v / 2 s; Root/Chest/ArmL/Merged 134 v / 2 s
- 2 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- B13 over the budget on the first window (0.006 ms): re-measured 0.0908 ms, kept the lower
- B13 in the noise band (0.006 ms, budget 0.005): re-run on a quiet PC before fixing
- Fix recipes: 2 in fixes.json (top: R8: body_height 1.7 -> 2.18 in res://art/units/fire/cinderlock/cinderlock.tscn (root) (the head top; x1.28 now), or lower the head / crest 0.06 m)

0 FAIL · 1 WARN · 33 PASS · 17 info · 0 skipped · 31 s

## Improve next
1. **Parts above body_height + 0.4** (WARN): R8w Parts above body_height + 0.4: Narrow Merged 0.38 m so the HP bar reads over the head [fixes.json #1] _(from R8w Parts above body_height + 0.4)_
2. **Shape richness (secondary shapes)** (INFO): Plain / blocky shapes: 52% of the surface is plain boxes / low-sided prisms: taper, bevel or bend the big limbs and the torso (tapered paths, more sides, a lathe profile); few surface directions (normal variety 0.87): tilt, curve and rotate parts so the light breaks on them _(from C1 Shape richness (secondary shapes), shot close)_
3. **Detail density 25 m / 40 m** (INFO): Busy at 25 m (12.0): merge small value changes into bigger blocks so the 40 m read stays clean _(from P4 Detail density 25 m / 40 m, shot z25)_

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12)
`{"draw":14,"face_verts":800,"frame_ms":0.005,"lights":0,"meshes":26,"n":100,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":4,"looping":1,"particles":10,"separate":6},"src":"art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12","verts":2500}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Chest/ArmR/Merged 610 v / 6 s; Root/Chest/Head/Face 558 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/Merged 346 v / 4 s; Root/Hips/Merged 331 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/Head/Merged 324 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/ArmL/Merged 226 v / 4 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/BowlFire 133 v / 1 s; Root/Hips/LegL/Merged 89 v / 1 s
- 1 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 5 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- Fix recipes: 1 in fixes.json (top: R8w Parts above body_height + 0.4: Narrow Merged 0.38 m so the HP bar reads over the head)

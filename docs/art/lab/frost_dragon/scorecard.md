# Art Lab scorecard: frost_dragon

Scene `res://art/units/titans/frost_dragon/frost_dragon.tscn` · kind **titan** / tier **titan** · kingdom ice · ground meadow · 2026-09-26 23:03:37 · lab v1.0

## Result: **PASS** · quality **96 / 100** (previous run 96, +0)

0 FAIL · 0 WARN · 21 PASS · 9 info · 0 skipped · 15 s

## Improve next
1. **Glow placement** (INFO): Move or add one glow point to the upper half (head, weapon tip, crest) so it reads above other units _(from P5 Glow placement, shot glow)_
2. **Idle / attack beats** (IDEA): Give the idle one secondary motion (tail flick, cloth, head turn) and the attack a 0.1 s anticipation pose so it reads at 40 m _(from anim strip)_
3. **Detail density at 25 m** (IDEA): Add 1-2 mid-size value accents (trim band, belt, plate edge, markings) that read at 25 m and merge into the big mass at 40 m _(from shot z25)_

| R6 | Team-colour visibility at 40 m | PASS 100 | 77% of body pixels change between kingdom colours (min pair 66%) | >= 3% (FAIL = set_team_color changes nothing) |  |
| R7 | HP bar over the body at 40 m | PASS 95 | bar hides 3% of the silhouette (gap -45 px) | <= 6% (FAIL > 20%); bar at body_height + 0.5 = 6.0 m, 4.16 m wide |  |

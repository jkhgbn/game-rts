## Improve next
1. **Unique materials** (FAIL): B8 11 -> 9 materials: use one material for look-alike pairs (albedo dE <= 15): `StandardMaterial3D#-75573` -> `StandardMaterial3D#-64324` (dE 0.0), `StandardMaterial3D#-19066` -> `StandardMaterial3D#-64324` (dE 0.0); 1 more to cut: no other pair is a look-alike (the rest differ by dE > 15), so fold per-part copies into the palette materials instead of merging different colours [fixes.json #1] _(from B8 Unique materials)_
2. **Shape richness (secondary shapes)** (INFO): Plain / blocky shapes: few surface directions (normal variety 0.51): tilt, curve and rotate parts so the light breaks on them _(from C1 Shape richness (secondary shapes), shot close)_
3. **Vertex use vs budget** (INFO): Only 10% of the vertex budget is used: spend it on the close / 25 m read (bevels, tapers, more sides on the big curved masses, secondary shapes) _(from C2 Vertex use vs budget, shot close)_
4. **Palette depth (close-up)** (INFO): Flat palette (6 colour / 6 value steps): add a darker and a lighter step of the main colours (trim, recesses, highlights on the top masses) _(from C3 Palette depth (close-up), shot close)_
5. **Silhouette hook** (INFO): Give the 40 m silhouette a hook (now 1.21): a shape that breaks the outline, e.g. horns, a raised weapon, a crest, a tail flick, a gap between limbs (at 40 m 1 px = ~4 cm: hooks thinner than ~0.25 m barely register) _(from P1 Silhouette hook, shot silhouette)_
6. **Asymmetric secondary shape** (INFO): Add an asymmetric secondary element to the front read (asymmetry 0.09): a shoulder banner, a one-sided weapon / shield, a broken horn (>= ~0.25 m wide, or it does not register at 40 m) _(from P2 Asymmetric secondary shape, shot silhouette)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H0 | Scene instantiates | PASS 100 | root Node3D, 22 nodes | instantiates without errors |  |
| B9 | Materials built per instance | INFO 100 | 14 material(s), 1 mesh(es) not shared by a 2nd instance (per-building copies, accepted by art-keep 8.6) | 0: materials / meshes are shared per type (art-units 2.2: zero runtime materials); buildings may copy theirs per instance (art-keep 8.6) |  |
| B10 | Allocations after _ready (actions) | PASS 100 | 0 node(s) created, net +0, 2nd action cycle: 0 node(s), 0 new material(s) | 0: pre-built emitters restarted, instance uniforms for flashes (art-units 6.10); materials swapped from a cache are not new |  |
| H1 | Errors from the asset while running | PASS 100 | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) | 0 (its folder + the kit) |  |

| B11 | Surfaces per instance | INFO | 14 surfaces over 6 meshes (each surface = 1 draw call) | about 1 surface per mesh after the merge; extra surfaces cost draw calls like extra meshes |  |
| B12 | Downward-facing triangles | INFO | 134 of 956 triangles (14%) face steeply down (normal y < -0.7) | hint when > 25 %: the camera looks from above (pitch 55); a sphere has ~15 %, bottom caps add the rest |  |

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, art-keep.md 9 numbers, step-12/13 rules: 0 lights)
`{"draw":32,"frame_ms":0.05,"lights":0,"materials":8,"n":8,"particles":90,"soft":{"runtime_mats":0},"src":"art-keep.md 9 numbers, step-12/13 rules: 0 lights","verts":12000}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Body/Walls 712 v / 5 s; Body/Roof 486 v / 5 s; Rubble 168 v / 1 s x7; Body/Plinth 72 v / 1 s; Body/Finial 21 v / 1 s; ContactDecal 4 v / 1 s
- 6 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 11 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- Fix recipes: 1 in fixes.json (top: B8 11 -> 9 materials: use one material for look-alike pairs (albedo dE <= 15): `StandardMaterial3D#-75573` -> `StandardMaterial3D#-64324` (dE 0.0), `StandardMat)

## Improve next
1. **Head height vs body_height** (WARN): R8: body_height 1.6 -> 2.26 in res://art/units/nature/bloomtender.tscn (root) and res://data/units/bloomtender.tres (the head top; x1.41 now), or lower the head / crest 0.26 m [fixes.json #1] _(from R8 Head height vs body_height)_
2. **Parts above body_height + 0.4** (WARN): R8w Parts above body_height + 0.4: Narrow Merged 0.43 m so the HP bar reads over the head [fixes.json #2] _(from R8w Parts above body_height + 0.4)_
3. **Contrast vs ground (meadow)** (PASS): Raise the contrast of the key read on meadow (dE 21.2): value is close to the ground (dL -4): lighten the top / back 15-20 % or add a dark saddle / pale belly band; the body sits in the ground's hue (gap 10 deg): push the main mass away from the grass hue (bronze, brown, blue-grey) or desaturate it _(from R3 Contrast vs ground (meadow), shot z40)_
4. **Contrast on the other grounds** (PASS): On heath the body drops to dE 12.0: add a value accent that separates it there too _(from R4 Contrast on the other grounds, shot z40)_
5. **Contrast in every team colour (meadow)** (PASS): In the nature team colour the body drops to dE 21.5 on meadow: add a value step around the team-colour area _(from R3t Contrast in every team colour (meadow), shot teams)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H0 | Scene instantiates | PASS 100 | root Node3D, 23 nodes | instantiates without errors |  |
| B9 | Materials built per instance | PASS 100 | 0 material(s), 0 mesh(es) not shared by a 2nd instance | 0: materials / meshes are shared per type (art-units 2.2: zero runtime materials); buildings may copy theirs per instance (art-keep 8.6) |  |
| B10 | Allocations after _ready (actions) | PASS 100 | 0 node(s) created, net +0, 2nd action cycle: 0 node(s), 0 new material(s) | 0: pre-built emitters restarted, instance uniforms for flashes (art-units 6.10); materials swapped from a cache are not new |  |
| H1 | Errors from the asset while running | PASS 100 | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) | 0 (its folder + the kit) |  |

## Budgets
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |

| B8 | Unique materials | INFO | 17 | no budget for unit/soldier |  |
| B1a | Authored build parts (before the merge) | INFO | 21 | info only: authoring detail is cheap when the kit merges it (B1 counts the drawn meshes), v1 limit 26 |  |
| B11 | Surfaces per instance | INFO | 27 surfaces over 8 meshes (each surface = 1 draw call) | about 1 surface per mesh after the merge; extra surfaces cost draw calls like extra meshes |  |
| B12 | Downward-facing triangles | INFO | 600 of 3586 triangles (16%) face steeply down (normal y < -0.7) | hint when > 25 %: the camera looks from above (pitch 55); a sphere has ~15 %, bottom caps add the rest |  |

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Chest/Head/Hat/HatMesh 626 v / 6 s; Root/Hips/Merged 526 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Censer/Pod 467 v / 4 s; Root/Chest/Merged 261 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Merged 255 v / 5 s; Root/Chest/Head/Merged 178 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/ArmL/Merged 101 v / 2 s; Shadow 4 v / 1 s
- 1 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 4 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- quick=1: light-preset sweep (R12) and style bible (S1) skipped
- quick=1: references (R2) and frame cost (B13) skipped
- Fix recipes: 2 in fixes.json (top: R8: body_height 1.6 -> 2.26 in res://art/units/nature/bloomtender.tscn (root) and res://data/units/bloomtender.tres (the head top; x1.41 now), or lower the head)

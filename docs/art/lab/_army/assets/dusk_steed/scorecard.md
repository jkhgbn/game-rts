## Result: **WARN** · quality **98 / 100**

0 FAIL · 1 WARN · 22 PASS · 8 info · 0 skipped · 24 s

## Improve next
1. **Glow points while walking (flicker)** (WARN): R5w Glow points while walking (flicker): The glow points blink while walking (0/1/1/1/1/1/1/1 per frame): put them on parts the gait does not cover [fixes.json #1] _(from R5w Glow points while walking (flicker), shot glow)_
2. **Surfaces per instance** (IDEA): Merge surfaces that share a material (34 surfaces for 8 meshes = 34 draw calls) _(from B11)_
3. **Idle / attack beats** (IDEA): Give the idle one secondary motion (tail flick, cloth, head turn) and the attack a 0.1 s anticipation pose so it reads at 40 m _(from anim strip)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H0 | Scene instantiates | PASS 100 | root Node3D, 19 nodes | instantiates without errors |  |
| B9 | Materials built per instance | PASS 100 | 0 material(s), 0 mesh(es) not shared by a 2nd instance | 0: materials / meshes are shared per type (art-units 2.2: zero runtime materials); buildings may copy theirs per instance (art-keep 8.6) |  |
| B10 | Allocations after _ready (actions) | PASS 100 | 0 node(s) created, net +0, 2nd action cycle: 0 node(s), 0 new material(s) | 0: pre-built emitters restarted, instance uniforms for flashes (art-units 6.10); materials swapped from a cache are not new |  |
| H1 | Errors from the asset while running | PASS 100 | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) | 0 (its folder + the kit) |  |

## Budgets
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Meshes after the kit merge | PASS 100 | 8 drawn (8 mesh + 0 multimesh); per pivot: (root) 1, Head 1, LegBL 1, LegBR 1, LegFL 1, LegFR 1 | <= 12 (cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount)) |  |
| B2 | Draw instances at rest | PASS 88 | 8 | <= 8 (cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount)) |  |
| B4 | Vertices | PASS 87 | 5769 (biggest: Merged 2229, Merged 1747, Merged 402, Merged 402) | <= 6000 soft (cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount)) |  |
| B5 | Real lights | PASS 100 | 0 | <= 0 (cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount)) |  |
| B6l | Looping particle systems | PASS 100 | 0 | <= 1 soft (cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount)) |  |
| B7 | Shadow casters | PASS 100 | 1 (Merged) | <= 2 soft (cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount)) |  |
| B8 | Unique materials | INFO | 12 | no budget for mount/mount |  |
| B1a | Authored build parts (before the merge) | INFO | 8 (model says 10) | info only: authoring detail is cheap when the kit merges it (B1 counts the drawn meshes), v1 limit 12 |  |
| B11 | Surfaces per instance | INFO | 34 surfaces over 8 meshes (each surface = 1 draw call) | about 1 surface per mesh after the merge; extra surfaces cost draw calls like extra meshes |  |
| B12 | Downward-facing triangles | INFO | 712 of 6724 triangles (10%) face steeply down (normal y < -0.7) | hint when > 25 %: the camera looks from above (pitch 55); a sphere has ~15 %, bottom caps add the rest |  |

## Readability at 40 m
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R9 | Feet on the ground | PASS 100 | lowest point 0.009 m | -0.08 .. +0.05 m (art-units 1.6) |  |

| R4k | Contrast on the home ground (marsh) | PASS 100 | dE 45.2, 0% melts (marsh is where shadow units stand most) | dE >= 20 on the kingdom's own ground (WARN only; stand-in patch for snow / ash / marsh) |  |

| R6 | Team-colour visibility at 40 m | PASS 100 | 26% of body pixels change between kingdom colours (min pair 24%) | >= 2% (FAIL = set_team_color changes nothing) |  |

| R6cb | Team colours for colour-blind players | PASS 82 | worst pair fire / nature (deutan): dE 14.0 on the team-colour area (normal vision 73.9; 226 px); deutan: fire / nature dE 14.0; protan: fire / nature dE 23.5; worst vs ground: fire colour (deutan) dE 60.1 | deutan / protan simulation: the worst kingdom pair differs by mean dE >= 12 on the team-colour area and the body stays >= dE 10 from the ground (WARN only) |  |
| R5 | Glow points at 40 m | PASS 100 | 1 point(s) above the bloom level 1.2 (median of 0/1/1): Merged; soft glows under the bloom (v1 count, luma > 0.4): 1 | 0-2 above the bloom level (art-units 1.4 / art-keep 0.4) |  |
| R11 | Reads while walking (40 m) | PASS 97 | walk frames vs rest: mean IoU 0.8 (min 0.76), area kept 97-101% (min 765 px), frame-to-frame IoU min 0.8; 8 frames 0.09 s apart | mean IoU walk vs rest >= 0.55, >= 70% of the rest area in every frame and >= R1's 150 px (WARN only) |  |
| R5w | Glow points while walking (flicker) | **WARN** 60 | points per frame 0/1/1/1/1/1/1/1 (median 1, range 1, 1 frame(s) at 0; at rest 1) | the glow-point count stays within +-1 over the walk cycle and never drops to 0 (WARN only) | Glow points that hide behind a swinging limb or dip under the bloom level blink at 40 m: move them to a steady part (head, chest, weapon head) or raise their energy |

## Animation

| A2 | death_finished | PASS 100 | after 1.01 s | emitted <= 2.0 s after play_death (gameplay fallback 2.0 s, art-units 6.7) |  |

## Polish (scored, never fails)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount))
`{"draw":8,"frame_ms":0.005,"lights":0,"meshes":12,"n":50,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":2,"looping":1,"verts":6000},"src":"cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount)"}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Mount/Merged 2229 v / 6 s; Root/Mount/Head/Merged 1747 v / 8 s; Root/Mount/LegBL/Merged 402 v / 4 s; Root/Mount/LegBR/Merged 402 v / 4 s; Root/Mount/LegFL/Merged 339 v / 4 s; Root/Mount/LegFR/Merged 339 v / 4 s; Root/Mount/Tail/Merged 307 v / 3 s; Shadow 4 v / 1 s
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- quick=1: light-preset sweep (R12) and style bible (S1) skipped
- quick=1: references (R2) and frame cost (B13) skipped
- Fix recipes: 1 in fixes.json (top: R5w Glow points while walking (flicker): The glow points blink while walking (0/1/1/1/1/1/1/1 per frame): put them on parts the gait does not cover)

## Improve next
1. **Team colours for colour-blind players** (WARN): R6cb Team colours for colour-blind players: For red-green colour-blind players fire / nature (deutan) look alike on this model (dE 11.9): add a value step inside the team-colour area [fixes.json #1] _(from R6cb Team colours for colour-blind players, shot teams)_
2. **Contrast vs ground (meadow)** (PASS): Raise the contrast of the key read on meadow (dE 22.7): value is close to the ground (dL -6): lighten the top / back 15-20 % or add a dark saddle / pale belly band; the body sits in the ground's hue (gap 12 deg): push the main mass away from the grass hue (bronze, brown, blue-grey) or desaturate it _(from R3 Contrast vs ground (meadow), shot z40)_
3. **Detail density 25 m / 40 m** (INFO): Busy at 25 m (12.3): merge small value changes into bigger blocks so the 40 m read stays clean _(from P4 Detail density 25 m / 40 m, shot z25)_
4. **Contrast on the other grounds** (PASS): On heath the body drops to dE 20.1: add a value accent that separates it there too _(from R4 Contrast on the other grounds, shot z40)_
5. **Contrast in every team colour (meadow)** (PASS): In the nature team colour the body drops to dE 21.8 on meadow: add a value step around the team-colour area _(from R3t Contrast in every team colour (meadow), shot teams)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H0 | Scene instantiates | PASS 100 | root Node3D, 22 nodes | instantiates without errors |  |
| B9 | Materials built per instance | PASS 100 | 0 material(s), 0 mesh(es) not shared by a 2nd instance | 0: materials / meshes are shared per type (art-units 2.2: zero runtime materials); buildings may copy theirs per instance (art-keep 8.6) |  |
| B10 | Allocations after _ready (actions) | PASS 100 | 0 node(s) created, net +0, 2nd action cycle: 0 node(s), 0 new material(s) | 0: pre-built emitters restarted, instance uniforms for flashes (art-units 6.10); materials swapped from a cache are not new |  |
| H1 | Errors from the asset while running | PASS 100 | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) | 0 (its folder + the kit) |  |

## Budgets
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Meshes after the kit merge | PASS 100 | 8 drawn (8 mesh + 0 multimesh); per pivot: (root) 1, ArmL 1, ArmR 1, Chest 1, Head 1, Hips 1 | <= 26 (art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12) |  |

| B7 | Shadow casters | PASS 98 | 3 (Merged, Merged, Merged) | <= 4 soft (art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12) |  |
| B8 | Unique materials | INFO | 11 | no budget for unit/soldier |  |
| B1a | Authored build parts (before the merge) | INFO | 25 | info only: authoring detail is cheap when the kit merges it (B1 counts the drawn meshes), v1 limit 26 |  |
| B11 | Surfaces per instance | INFO | 20 surfaces over 8 meshes (each surface = 1 draw call) | about 1 surface per mesh after the merge; extra surfaces cost draw calls like extra meshes |  |
| B12 | Downward-facing triangles | INFO | 386 of 2846 triangles (13%) face steeply down (normal y < -0.7) | hint when > 25 %: the camera looks from above (pitch 55); a sphere has ~15 %, bottom caps add the rest |  |

## Readability at 40 m

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R9 | Feet on the ground | PASS 100 | lowest point 0.014 m | -0.08 .. +0.05 m (art-units 1.6) |  |
| R8 | Head height vs body_height | PASS 96 | head top 1.49 m / body_height 1.4 (x1.07) | x0.75-1.25 (art-units 1.1: the HP bar hangs at body_height + 0.5) |  |
| R10 | Footprint vs selection radius | PASS 100 | x 0.53 / z 0.62 m (radius 0.4, from thornling.tres) | x <= radius x 1.4, z <= x 1.4 (art-units 1.1; parts thinner than 8 cm ignored) |  |
| R1 | Silhouette area at 40 m | PASS 100 | 439 px (29 x 35 bbox; 55 m: 227 px) | >= 120 px (FAIL < 45) at 1600 x 900 |  |
| R3 | Contrast vs ground (meadow) | PASS 85 | mean-colour dE 22.7, 2% of the body melts (within dE 15 of the ground); body L* 56.9 C 28.1 vs ground L* 63.3 C 48.4, hue gap 12 deg; top third (world height) dE 29.8, L* 60.8; per-pixel dE 40.6, outline 36.6 | mean-colour dE >= 20 and <= 35 % melting (FAIL: dE < 10 or > 60 % melting): the body must not melt into the grass |  |
| R4k | Contrast on the home ground (old_wood) | PASS 97 | dE 29.5, 0% melts (old_wood is where nature units stand most) | dE >= 20 on the kingdom's own ground (WARN only; stand-in patch for snow / ash / marsh) |  |
| R4 | Contrast on the other grounds | PASS 88 | worst heath: dE 20.1 (heath dE 20.1, old_wood dE 29.5, riverbank dE 30.5, snow dE 42.4, ash dE 44.8, sand dE 25.9, marsh dE 46.6) | dE >= 10 on every skirmish ground (WARN only) |  |

| R6cb | Team colours for colour-blind players | **WARN** 45 | worst pair fire / nature (deutan): dE 11.9 on the team-colour area (normal vision 73.5; 192 px); deutan: fire / nature dE 11.9; protan: fire / nature dE 22.9; worst vs ground: fire colour (deutan) dE 14.1 | deutan / protan simulation: the worst kingdom pair differs by mean dE >= 12 on the team-colour area and the body stays >= dE 10 from the ground (WARN only) | Red-green colour blindness merges hues, not values: give the team-colour area a value step or a pattern (trim, banner shape) and keep it large; a team-palette change is for the lead (KINGDOM_COLORS) |
| R7 | HP bar over the body at 40 m | PASS 99 | bar hides 0% of the silhouette (gap -1 px) | <= 8% (FAIL > 25%); bar at body_height + 0.5 = 1.9 m, 1.04 m wide |  |

| R5w | Glow points while walking (flicker) | PASS 100 | points per frame 1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1 (median 1, range 0, 0 frame(s) at 0; at rest 2) | the glow-point count stays within +-1 over the walk cycle and never drops to 0 (WARN only) |  |

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Chest/Merged 559 v / 5 s; Root/Chest/ArmL/Merged 479 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Merged 479 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/Head/Merged 332 v / 5 s; Root/Hips/LegL/Merged 186 v / 1 s; Root/Hips/LegR/Merged 186 v / 1 s; Root/Hips/Merged 175 v / 1 s; Shadow 4 v / 1 s
- 1 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 3 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- quick=1: light-preset sweep (R12) and style bible (S1) skipped
- quick=1: references (R2) and frame cost (B13) skipped
- Fix recipes: 1 in fixes.json (top: R6cb Team colours for colour-blind players: For red-green colour-blind players fire / nature (deutan) look alike on this model (dE 11.9): add a value step insid)

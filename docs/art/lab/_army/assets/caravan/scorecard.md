1. **Vertices** (FAIL): B4 4651 -> 2392 (want <= 2500): `Merged` 1710 -> 855 verts; `Merged` 902 -> 451 verts; `Merged` 582 -> 291 verts; `Merged` 427 -> 214 verts; `Merged` 295 -> 148 verts; `Lantern` 231 -> 116 verts; `Merged` 111 -> 56 verts; `Merged` 111 -> 56 verts; `Merged` 111 -> 56 verts; `Merged` 111 -> 89 verts (fewer segments: cylinders 6-8, spheres 10 x 5; drop hidden / bottom faces) [fixes.json #1] _(from B4 Vertices)_
2. **Glow points at 40 m** (WARN): Glow points 0 -> 1 (want 1-3): add 1 glow point(s) high on the body (eyes / rune / weapon tip): an unshaded kit glow with energy >= 1.7 or emission x colour >= 1.3 x the bloom level 1.2 [fixes.json #2] _(from R5 Glow points at 40 m, shot glow)_
3. **Attack reads at 40 m** (WARN): A3 Attack reads at 40 m: Push the attack pose: the strike should change >= 30% of the 40 m silhouette (now 0%) [fixes.json #3] _(from A3 Attack reads at 40 m, shot anim)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H0 | Scene instantiates | PASS 100 | root Node3D, 26 nodes | instantiates without errors |  |
| B9 | Materials built per instance | PASS 100 | 0 material(s), 0 mesh(es) not shared by a 2nd instance | 0: materials / meshes are shared per type (art-units 2.2: zero runtime materials); buildings may copy theirs per instance (art-keep 8.6) |  |
| B10 | Allocations after _ready (actions) | PASS 100 | 0 node(s) created, net +0, 2nd action cycle: 0 node(s), 0 new material(s) | 0: pre-built emitters restarted, instance uniforms for flashes (art-units 6.10); materials swapped from a cache are not new |  |
| H1 | Errors from the asset while running | PASS 100 | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) | 0 (its folder + the kit) |  |

## Budgets
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Meshes after the kit merge | PASS 100 | 12 drawn (12 mesh + 0 multimesh); per pivot: Chest 3, Head 2, (root) 1, Hips 1, LegBL 1, LegBR 1 | <= 26 (art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12) |  |
| B2 | Draw instances at rest | PASS 93 | 12 | <= 14 (art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12) |  |
| B3 | keep_separate parts | PASS 100 | 2 | <= 6 soft (art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12) |  |
| B4 | Vertices | **FAIL** 0 | 4651 (biggest: Merged 1710, Merged 902, Merged 582, Merged 427) | <= 2500 (art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12) | Fewer segments (cylinders 6-8, spheres radial 10 / rings 5), no hidden faces |
| B5 | Real lights | PASS 100 | 0 | <= 0 (art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12) |  |
| B6 | Particle systems | INFO | 1 | no budget for unit/soldier |  |
| B6l | Looping particle systems | PASS 100 | 0 | <= 1 soft (art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12) |  |
| B6p | Looping particles alive | PASS 100 | 0 | <= 10 soft (art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12) |  |
| B7 | Shadow casters | PASS 98 | 3 (Merged, Merged, Merged) | <= 4 soft (art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12) |  |
| B8 | Unique materials | INFO | 7 | no budget for unit/soldier |  |
| B1a | Authored build parts (before the merge) | INFO | 13 | info only: authoring detail is cheap when the kit merges it (B1 counts the drawn meshes), v1 limit 26 |  |
| B11 | Surfaces per instance | INFO | 27 surfaces over 12 meshes (each surface = 1 draw call) | about 1 surface per mesh after the merge; extra surfaces cost draw calls like extra meshes |  |
| B12 | Downward-facing triangles | INFO | 729 of 5572 triangles (13%) face steeply down (normal y < -0.7) | hint when > 25 %: the camera looks from above (pitch 55); a sphere has ~15 %, bottom caps add the rest |  |

## Readability at 40 m
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R9 | Feet on the ground | PASS 100 | lowest point -0.005 m | -0.08 .. +0.05 m (art-units 1.6) |  |
| R8 | Head height vs body_height | PASS 100 | head top 1.89 m / body_height 1.9 (x1.0) | x0.75-1.25 (art-units 1.1: the HP bar hangs at body_height + 0.5) |  |
| R10 | Footprint vs selection radius | PASS 100 | x 0.85 / z 1.82 m (radius 0.8, from caravan.tres) | x <= radius x 1.4, z <= x 2.4 (art-units 1.1; parts thinner than 8 cm ignored) |  |

| R7 | HP bar over the body at 40 m | PASS 91 | bar hides 7% of the silhouette (gap -17 px) | <= 8% (FAIL > 25%); bar at body_height + 0.5 = 2.4 m, 2.08 m wide |  |
| R5 | Glow points at 40 m | **WARN** 49 | 0 point(s) above the bloom level 1.2 (median of 0/0/0); soft glows under the bloom (v1 count, luma > 0.4): 1 | 1-3 above the bloom level (art-units 1.4 / art-keep 0.4) | Add a glow point (eyes / rune / weapon, emission >= 2.5 so the bloom carries it); 1 soft glow(s) sit under the bloom level: raise one to emission >= 2.4 |
| R11 | Reads while walking (40 m) | PASS 100 | walk frames vs rest: mean IoU 0.94 (min 0.92), area kept 99-101% (min 2358 px), frame-to-frame IoU min 0.92; 8 frames 0.09 s apart | mean IoU walk vs rest >= 0.55, >= 70% of the rest area in every frame and >= R1's 120 px (WARN only) |  |

| A2 | death_finished | PASS 100 | after 1.01 s | emitted <= 2.0 s after play_death (gameplay fallback 2.0 s, art-units 6.7) |  |

## Polish (scored, never fails)

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12)
`{"draw":14,"frame_ms":0.005,"lights":0,"meshes":26,"n":100,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":4,"looping":1,"particles":10,"separate":6},"src":"art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12","verts":2500}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Chest/Merged 1710 v / 4 s; Root/Mount/Merged 902 v / 4 s; Root/Hips/Merged 582 v / 2 s; Root/Mount/Head/Merged 427 v / 2 s; Root/Chest/Head/Merged 295 v / 3 s; Root/Chest/Lantern 231 v / 2 s; Root/Mount/LegFL/Merged 111 v / 2 s; Root/Mount/LegFR/Merged 111 v / 2 s
- 1 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 1 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
- quick=1: light-preset sweep (R12) and style bible (S1) skipped
- quick=1: references (R2) and frame cost (B13) skipped
- Fix recipes: 3 in fixes.json (top: B4 4651 -> 2392 (want <= 2500): `Merged` 1710 -> 855 verts; `Merged` 902 -> 451 verts; `Merged` 582 -> 291 verts; `Merged` 427 -> 214 verts; `Merged` 295 -> 148)

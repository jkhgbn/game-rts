### What got worse (0)
Nothing got worse.

### Score delta per check (1 changed, 39 unchanged)
| # | Check | Before | After | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P4 | Detail density 25 m / 40 m | INFO 89 | INFO 88 | -0.6 (noisy) |

Changed pixels per shot: z40 0.7 %, z55 0.6 %, z25 0.8 %, close 0.6 %, turns 0.2 %, anim 1.1 %, silhouette 0.0 %, lineup 5.9 % · [diff sheet](diff_sheet.png) (before / after / changed mask)

## Improve next
1. **Shape richness (secondary shapes)** (INFO): Plain / blocky shapes: few surface directions (normal variety 0.61): tilt, curve and rotate parts so the light breaks on them _(from C1 Shape richness (secondary shapes), shot close)_
2. **Palette depth (close-up)** (INFO): Flat palette (11 colour / 7 value steps): add a darker and a lighter step of the main colours (trim, recesses, highlights on the top masses) _(from C3 Palette depth (close-up), shot close)_
3. **Distinct from references (black masks)** (PASS): Make it read apart from ice_forge (IoU 0.66): change one big shape of the silhouette _(from R2 Distinct from references (black masks), shot silhouette)_
4. **Detail density 25 m / 40 m** (INFO): Detail density is low at 25 m (2.5): add 1-2 mid-size value blocks (trim band, belt, plate edge) that read at 25 m and merge at 40 m _(from P4 Detail density 25 m / 40 m, shot z25)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Body/Walls 1741 v / 3 s; Body/PlinthBase 1574 v / 1 s; Body/Roof 1158 v / 2 s; Body/CargoSled/CargoParts 843 v / 1 s; Body/SledStall/StallParts 751 v / 1 s; Body/Mast/MastParts 670 v / 1 s; Body/SledStall/StallCanopy 242 v / 1 s; Body/Mast/ScaleBeam/PanL/PanLParts 240 v / 2 s
- 9 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 8 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist

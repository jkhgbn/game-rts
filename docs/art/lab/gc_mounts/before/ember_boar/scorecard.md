## Improve next
1. **Silhouette hook** (INFO): Give the 40 m silhouette a hook (now 1.86): a shape that breaks the outline, e.g. horns, a raised weapon, a crest, a tail flick, a gap between limbs (at 40 m 1 px = ~4 cm: hooks thinner than ~0.25 m barely register) _(from P1 Silhouette hook, shot silhouette)_
2. **Asymmetric secondary shape** (INFO): Add an asymmetric secondary element to the front read (asymmetry 0.13): a shoulder banner, a one-sided weapon / shield, a broken horn (>= ~0.25 m wide, or it does not register at 40 m) _(from P2 Asymmetric secondary shape, shot silhouette)_
3. **Team-colour visibility at 40 m** (PASS): Give the team colour more top-facing area (now 10% of the 40 m body; aim ~20%): shoulder cloth, a banner, the cape top _(from R6 Team-colour visibility at 40 m, shot teams)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H0 | Scene instantiates | PASS 100 | root Node3D, 20 nodes | instantiates without errors |  |
| B9 | Materials built per instance | PASS 100 | 0 material(s), 0 mesh(es) not shared by a 2nd instance | 0: materials / meshes are shared per type (art-units 2.2: zero runtime materials); buildings may copy theirs per instance (art-keep 8.6) |  |
| B10 | Allocations after _ready (actions) | PASS 100 | 0 node(s) created, net +0, 2nd action cycle: 0 node(s), 0 new material(s) | 0: pre-built emitters restarted, instance uniforms for flashes (art-units 6.10); materials swapped from a cache are not new |  |
| H1 | Errors from the asset while running | PASS 100 | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) | 0 (its folder + the kit) |  |

## Budgets

| B8 | Unique materials | INFO | 12 | no budget for mount/mount |  |

| B11 | Surfaces per instance | INFO | 31 surfaces over 8 meshes (each surface = 1 draw call) | about 1 surface per mesh after the merge; extra surfaces cost draw calls like extra meshes |  |
| B12 | Downward-facing triangles | INFO | 780 of 7110 triangles (10%) face steeply down (normal y < -0.7) | hint when > 25 %: the camera looks from above (pitch 55); a sphere has ~15 %, bottom caps add the rest |  |

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount))
`{"draw":8,"face_verts":600,"frame_ms":0.005,"lights":0,"meshes":12,"n":50,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":2,"looping":1,"verts":6000},"src":"cavalry-mounts.md 10 (mount)"}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Mount/Merged 2481 v / 8 s; Root/Mount/Head/Merged 1491 v / 7 s; Root/Mount/LegBL/Merged 297 v / 3 s; Root/Mount/LegBR/Merged 297 v / 3 s; Root/Mount/LegFL/Merged 220 v / 3 s; Root/Mount/LegFR/Merged 220 v / 3 s; Root/Mount/Tail/Merged 137 v / 3 s; Shadow 4 v / 1 s
- 1 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist

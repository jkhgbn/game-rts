# Art Lab scorecard: ember_archer

Scene `res://art/units/fire/ember_archer.tscn` · kind **unit** / tier **soldier** · kingdom fire · ground meadow · 2026-09-26 23:56:39 · lab v2.0

## Result: **FAIL** · quality **91 / 100** (previous run 91, +0)

1 FAIL · 2 WARN · 25 PASS · 10 info · 0 skipped · 30 s

## Improve next
1. **Frame cost** (FAIL): Cut the per-frame script cost (0.0109 ms per instance): write pivots only when they change, skip work at the far tiers _(from B13 Frame cost)_
2. **Contrast in every team colour (meadow)** (WARN): In the nature team colour the body drops to dE 7.8 on meadow: add a value step around the team-colour area _(from R3t Contrast in every team colour (meadow), shot teams)_
3. **Silhouette hook** (INFO): Give the 40 m silhouette a hook (now 1.99): a shape that breaks the outline, e.g. horns, a raised weapon, a crest, a tail flick, a gap between limbs (at 40 m 1 px = ~4 cm: hooks thinner than ~0.25 m barely register) _(from P1 Silhouette hook, shot silhouette)_
4. **Distinct from references (black masks)** (PASS): Make it read apart from tracker (IoU 0.67): change one big shape of the silhouette _(from R2 Distinct from references (black masks), shot silhouette)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| B9 | Materials built per instance | PASS 100 | 0 material(s), 0 mesh(es) not shared by a 2nd instance | 0: materials / meshes are shared per type (art-units 2.2: zero runtime materials) |  |
| B10 | Allocations after _ready (actions) | PASS 100 | 0 node(s) created, net +0, 2nd action cycle: 0 node(s), 0 new material(s) | 0: pre-built emitters restarted, instance uniforms for flashes (art-units 6.10); materials swapped from a cache are not new |  |
| H1 | Errors from the asset while running | PASS 100 | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) | 0 (its folder + the kit) |  |

## Budgets
| # | Check | Result | Measured | Rule | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| B8 | Unique materials | INFO | 14 | no budget for unit/soldier |  |
| B1a | Authored build parts (before the merge) | INFO | 25 | info only: authoring detail is cheap when the kit merges it (B1 counts the drawn meshes), v1 limit 26 |  |
| B11 | Surfaces per instance | INFO | 22 surfaces over 10 meshes (each surface = 1 draw call) | about 1 surface per mesh after the merge; extra surfaces cost draw calls like extra meshes |  |
| B12 | Downward-facing triangles | INFO | 235 of 1730 triangles (13%) face steeply down (normal y < -0.7) | hint when > 25 %%: the camera looks from above (pitch 55); a sphere has ~15 %%, bottom caps add the rest |  |
| B13 | Frame cost | **FAIL** 0 | 0.0109 ms process per instance (100 animated at 40 m: +1.09 ms process, render CPU +0.71 ms, GPU +0.3 ms) | <= 0.005 ms per instance (art-units.md 8, tier3-extras.md 12) | One _process per model, cached pivots, no get_node / allocation per frame, respect the distance tiers (art-units 6.10) |

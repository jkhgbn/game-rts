## Improve next
1. **Shape richness (secondary shapes)** (INFO): Plain / blocky shapes: 88% of the surface is plain boxes / low-sided prisms: taper, bevel or bend the big limbs and the torso (tapered paths, more sides, a lathe profile); few surface directions (normal variety 0.74): tilt, curve and rotate parts so the light breaks on them _(from C1 Shape richness (secondary shapes), shot close)_
2. **Contrast on the other grounds** (PASS): On snow the body drops to dE 19.4: add a value accent that separates it there too _(from R4 Contrast on the other grounds, shot z40)_
3. **Distinct from references (black masks)** (PASS): Make it read apart from ruin_warden (IoU 0.62): change one big shape of the silhouette _(from R2 Distinct from references (black masks), shot silhouette)_
4. **Tops light, bottoms dark** (INFO): Lighten the top masses / darken the legs and base (top - bottom now +8 L*, aim >= +10) _(from P3 Tops light, bottoms dark, shot z40)_

## Health (errors, allocations, hooks)

| H1 | Errors from the asset while running | PASS 100 | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) | 0 (its folder + the kit) |  |

## Budgets

## Budget used (`tools/art_lab/lab_budgets.gd`, champions.md 4 / 13, tier3-extras.md 12)
`{"draw":16,"face_verts":900,"frame_ms":0.005,"lights":0,"materials":5,"meshes":26,"n":100,"runtime_mats":0,"soft":{"casters":4,"looping":1,"particles":8,"separate":6,"verts":3000},"src":"champions.md 4 / 13, tier3-extras.md 12"}`

## Notes
- Per-mesh vertices (biggest first): Root/Chest/ArmL/DoorShield 844 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/Head/Face 746 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/ArmR/Merged 332 v / 1 s; Root/Chest/Merged 257 v / 2 s; Root/Chest/Head/Variant 162 v / 1 s; Root/Hips/Merged 151 v / 2 s; Root/Chest/Head/Merged 120 v / 1 s; Root/Hips/LegL/Merged 71 v / 1 s
- 1 hidden parts at rest (toggled states, not counted as draws)
- 2 materials are built in code (fine when cached per type: see B9)
- terrain: snow / ash / sand / marsh are flat stand-in patches (biome GROUND_TINT): ground.gdshader has no step-12b terrain layers yet (terrain.md 7.1 `terrain_mask`); the lab switches to them by itself once they exist
